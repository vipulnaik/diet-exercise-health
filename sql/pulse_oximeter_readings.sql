It was taken with the blood pressure cuff on my left arm (I used the right index finger for the reading) but prior to taking the blood pressure readings. I started observing about 30 seconds after putting my finger in the pulse oximeter. Within the observation period, the heart rate started around 49-50 bpm, then briefly rose to 55 bpm and later settled back in the 49-52 bpm range. The SpO2 fluctuated between 99% and 100% during the observation period. The heart rate range was consistent with the two point estimates (53 bpm and 49 bpm) obtained as part of the blood pressure readings I took immediately afterward.'),

Although it''s outside the two-hour window after meals when heart rate tends to be more elevated, the larger size of winter meals likely means that heart rate stays somewhat elevated for longer, which might explain my heart rate being higher than my historical resting heart rate (I haven''t been able to get a successful morning reading with the pulse oximeter, likely because the pulse oximeter has difficulty getting a reading in the cold, so I can''t directly compare with a morning reading on a nearby day). I don''t know if this is relevant, but including it anyway: I had a blood draw the previous day (2024-12-13); see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2024/2024-12-13-blood-tests.md for details. The heart rate was around 60-62 bpm at the start of the interval, rose to 71 bpm, and dropped back down to 65 bpm near the end. This pulse oximeter reading was taken shortly after two blood pressure readings that both measured the heart rate as 60 bpm.

This is the first time after a while that the pulse oximeter has succeeded in giving clear readings, and it likely reflects that the temperature has returned to normal.

Within the observation period, the temperature started at 75 bpm, dropped to 71 bpm, then rose up to 76-77 bpm, then dropped again to around 71 bpm; it continued like this for a few cycles.');
