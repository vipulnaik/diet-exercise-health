  ('December 2024 LabCorp tests','Omega-3 total','%',5.5,NULL,3.6,'Low','This test was a followup to the September 2024 omega-3 test, intended to gauge the impact of recent changes. The measurement is of the percentage by weight of omega-3 fatty acids. This test was taken as a followup measurement after increasing my baseline omega-3 dose from 1 to 2 softgels per day, and also diversifying from just using Freshfield to using both Freshfield and sapling. However, as in September, I did pause supplementation for two days prior to the test. Other changes I made in the interim period included adding seaweed to my diet, though the impact on omega-3 levels is expected to be small. Overall, the drop in the omega-3 percentage (3.6 compared to 4.4) after increasing the supplement dose and otherwise maintaining similar conditions is puzzling. However, I suspect that the omega-3 dose increase is actually working considering that my HDL-C is up and triglycerides are down quite a bit compared to the previous test. This makes me suspect that the test is mostly just picking up on the lack of recent supplement consumption. Moreover, since my plasma triglycerides are now lower, this likely means faster turnover of the omega-3 in triglycerides (which is what the test is measuring) making the test reading even more sensitive to recent consumption. A red blood cell measurement such as https://omegaquant.com/3-reasons-to-measure-omega-3-levels-in-red-blood-cells/ may be a better approach, since it is not swayed by very recent consumption and is a better measure of the actal use of omega-3. But it would need a self-draw of blood. My tentative plan is to continue with my current supplementation regime and to not pause omega-3 supplementation for the two days prior to my next test and get a reading in those favorable cicumstances.'),

Of the three omega-3 readings, this is the one that seems to be contrary to expectations. To wit, prior to the previous test, I was taking one DHA + DPA supplement (Freshfield). Between the two tests, I added a DHA + EPA supplement (sapling). DHA levels are therefore expected to almost double, but in fact the plasma DHA levels dropped from 3.4 in the preceding test to 2.4 in this one. My suspicion is that the pause on supplementation for two days prior to the test makes plasma DHA levels hard to predict. Moreover, since triglycerides are in general lowered by omega-3 supplementation, this increases the overall turnover of triglycerides and in particular the omega-3 portion of them too. However, it''s not clear to me why this effect would be seen primarily in DHA whie DPA and EPA behaved according to expectations.
