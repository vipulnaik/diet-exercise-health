# Dental self-exam checklist log

This is the execution log for the [dental self-exam checklist](../checklists/dental-self-exam-checklist.md).

## 2024-10-07

This was my first pass of the checklist, executed right after I picked
up the mirror and intraoral camera and two days prior to my dental
cleaning appointment. I included information on it as part of the
[2024-10-09 dental cleaning
doc](../events/2024/2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md).

## 2024-10-09

This was my second pass of the checklist, executed a few hours after
my dental cleaning appointment.

## 2024-10-29

This was my first periodic execution of the checklist, not tied to a
dental cleaning.

- [x] Examine teeth in mirror; look for things like stains, plaque, and recession
  - For front teeth, look in the normal mirror, using the hands to pull parts of the mouth to get a better view
  - For back teeth, open mouth wide; use the dental mirror particularly for the back middle teeth and to get an additional angle on the back side teeth (the back side teeth can be partly viewed directly in the mirror if the mouth is wide open)
  - Stain: some distinctive color pattern, usually black, often seen on back side teeth
  - Plaque: "thin, slightly fuzzy, colorless film that might not be readily visible to the naked eye, but you can often feel it with your tongue as a slightly rough texture on your teeth" though in some cases it can show a yellow discoloration
  - Gum recession: gumline is receded from where it should be; the place where it should be is the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and any gap between that and the gumline means the cementum is exposed; this gap area tends to look yellower than the white tooth
- Use pressure testing to confirm the health and strength of the teeth; there should be no sharp pain beyon the sensation of pressure and maybe in some cases a stretch or massage fee, and it should go away within a few seconds of the pressure being removed
  - [x] Using a floss pick, push moderately hard against each interdental gap
  - [x] Push backward with a clean finger on the exposed part of each of the front teeth
  - [x] Push forward (outward) with a clean finger on the exposed part of each of the back teeth
  - [x] Push backward with a clean finger on the gumline part for each of the front teeth
  - [x] Push forward (outward) with a clean finger on the gumline part of each of the back teeth
  - SEE MY NOTES BELOW
- [x] Take photos of front and back teeth using the intraoral camera and save to GitHub in the following order (there should be a total of 12 photos)
  - All back teeth before all front teeth
  - Within each, all upper (maxillary) teeth before all lower (mandibular) teeth
  - Within each, left, then middle, then right
  - The location to save in GitHub should be in the `diet-exercise-health-private` repo in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - Also save in my Google Drive in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - I WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE PHOTOS OF THE BOTTOM BACK TEETH due to tongue interference and excess salivation.
- [x] Compare these photos with the previous photos
  - SEE MY NOTES BELOW

Overall notes:

* The only teeth for which I can see very clear recession are the
  canines and to a lesser extent the teeth next to them.

* There are lots of black stains on the back teeth, particularly the
  back middle teeth. The front teeth are relatively free of stains.

* I could not feel much plaque. From the photos, it looks like there
  is some plaque near the roots, and it's more pronounced on the back
  teeth than the front teeth. It also seems more pronounced on the
  middle teeth than the side teeth. It largely correlates with stains.

* I did not experience any pain from any of the forms of pressure I
  applied, suggesting that my teeth are healthy and strong.

* I had significant tongue interference when taking photos of my lower
  back teeth. Even when I tucked my tongue away, saliva got in the way
  of good photos. The best photos I got were of the upper back teeth.
