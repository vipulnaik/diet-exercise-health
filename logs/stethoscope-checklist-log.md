# Stethoscope checklist log

This is the execution log for the [stethoscope
checklist](../checklists/stethoscope-checklist.md).

I have been executing the stethoscope checklist for about a year prior
to the start of the log, but did not have a formal checklist or
recording procedure. I am not bothering to backfill past data in the
log (I have private notes but they don't follow the same format).

## 2025-12-20

### Chest portion

- [x] Make the stethoscope listen to the chest side and put the earpieces on; confirm that sound is coming through (if the ears are reversed the sound is much fainter)
- [x] Place the chest side of the stethoscope on the chest area in front of the heart and listen for heart sounds and murmurs; confirm that there are no unusual sounds other than S1 and S2
  - NOTE: Due to the high heart rate as a result of doing this reading right after exercise, subtle heart sounds might have been missed. Next time, I should try to do this prior to exercise.
- [x] Count and record the number of heartbeats in a minute
  - Number: 80 bpm
  - Comments on consistency / variability: Very consistent! I recorded 4 beats every 3 seconds.
  - NOTE: This measurement was taken right after finishing exercise, so the high heart rate is expected.

### Diaphragm portion

- [x] Make the stethoscope listen to the diaphragm and put the earpieces on; confirm that sound is coming through (if the ears are reversed the sound is much fainter)
- [x] Place the diaphragm side of the stethoscope on various parts of the diaphragm area and confirm that I can consistently hear the peristalsis sounds
