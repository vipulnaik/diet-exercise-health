# Hearing checklist log

This is the execution log for the [hearing checklist](../checklists/hearing-checklist.md).

## 2025-02-23

- [x] Run through and record results for online hearing test at https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) in SQL; compare with the previous results to see if there is any concerning loss of hearing, and if so, schedule a followup test for a week later
- Run through and record results for test where I try to play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) all in one ear and find the lowest possible volume for each ear where I can make out the words -- if it's higher than 1/64, schedule followup test in about a week
  - [x] Left ear with normal headphones
    - Barely audible at times and I lost the thread a few times
    - UPDATE 2025-03-07: I am not sure if I checked whether the within-YouTube volume setting was at max; I should make sure to check this in the future; however, when trying on 2025-03-07, I replicated a similar result
  - [x] Right ear with normal headphones
    - Barely audible at times and I lost the thread a few times

  - [x] Left ear with bone conduction headphones
    - Extremely clear throughout

- Check for balance when I play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo
  - [x] Normal headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [x] Bone conduction headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [x] For normal headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness
  - [x] For bone conduction headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness

## 2025-04-02 and later

The air conduction portions of the test were done on 2025-04-02 along with a switch to new headphones.

  - [x] Put on normal headphones
  - [x] Make sure that the volume of the computer is set to max
  - [x] Check that the left speaker is on the left ear and the right speaker is on the right ear (this might require temporary balance adjustment)
  - [x] Switch balance back to the middle
  - [x] Do the Resound online test and record results as you go along
  - (The bone conduction headphones steps are deferred)
  - [ ] Put on bone conduction headphones
  - [ ] Make sure that the volume of the computer is set to max

  - [x] Make sure that within-YouTube volume is set to max
  - [x] Left ear with normal headphones (if the headphones are oriented wrong, re-wear the headphones)
  - [x] Right ear with normal headphones
  - [x] Reduce within-YouTube volume to 50%
