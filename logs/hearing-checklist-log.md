# Hearing checklist log

This is the execution log for the [hearing
checklist](../checklists/hearing-checklist.md).

## 2025-02-23

- [x] Run through and record results for online hearing test at https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) in SQL; compare with the previous results to see if there is any concerning loss of hearing, and if so, schedule a followup test for a week later
- Run through and record results for test where I try to play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) all in one ear and find the lowest possible volume for each ear where I can make out the words -- if it's higher than 1/64, schedule followup test in about a week
  - [x] Left ear with normal headphones
    - Barely audible at times and I lost the thread a few times
    - UPDATE 2025-03-07: I am not sure if I checked whether the within-YouTube volume setting was at max; I should make sure to check this in the future; however, when trying on 2025-03-07, I replicated a similar result

    - Extremely clear throughout

- Check for balance when I play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo
  - [x] Normal headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [x] Bone conduction headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [x] For normal headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness
  - [x] For bone conduction headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness

## 2025-04-02 and 2025-04-10

The air conduction portions of the test (excluding max frequency
hearing test) were done on 2025-04-02 along with a switch to new
headphones. The bone conduction headphones portion and the entirety of
the max frequency test were done on 2025-04-10.

  - [x] Put on normal headphones
  - [x] Make sure that the volume of the computer is set to max
  - [x] Check that the left speaker is on the left ear and the right speaker is on the right ear (this might require temporary balance adjustment)
  - [x] Switch balance back to the middle
  - [x] Do the Resound online test and record results as you go along
  - (The bone conduction headphones steps are deferred)

  - [x] Make sure that within-YouTube volume is set to max
  - [x] Left ear with normal headphones (if the headphones are oriented wrong, re-wear the headphones)
  - [x] Right ear with normal headphones
  - [x] Reduce within-YouTube volume to 50%
  - [x] Left ear with normal headphones (if the headphones are oriented wrong, re-wear the headphones)
  - [x] Right ear with normal headphones
  - [x] Set YouTube volume to max again
  - [x] Left ear with bone conduction headphones
  - [x] Right ear with bone conduction headphones
  - [x] Reduce within-YouTube volume to 50%
  - [x] Left ear with bone conduction headphones
    - Words are cutting out a bit to me, but I can generally follow the gist of things

- Do a max frequency hearing test using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUmbmssqHOY
  - [x] Normal headphones, start the video, setting volume to half the max
  - [x] Right before the GO point, put finger on space bar and fingers of right hand on volume controls, close eyes, note current time, and hit space bar
  - [x] Increase volume as sound gets fainter, and open eyes when sound gets inaudible even at max volume
    - Pause video if it is still playing
    - If video stopped, do I see the next video recommendations populate right as I open my eyes? That's confirmation that I stopped hearing the sound right when it finished playing. If they are already populated, that might mean that I was hearing phantom noises after the video stopped.
    - In the case that the recommendations were already populated, look at the time; if it is between 81 and 84 seconds after I closed my eyes, I am fine and I got to 20 kHz; otherwise, redo the test
    - If I paused the video before getting to 20 kHz, do play/pause testing to see if I can hear a clear play/pause difference, and use that to refine my estimate of max frequency
    - Final frequency estimate: 20 kHz
  - [x] Bone conduction headphones, start the video, setting volume to half the max

    - Final frequency estimate: 15700 Hz (after a lot of back-and-forth; however, I am unsure if this is due to volume limitations or headphone frequency profile limitations)

## 2025-10-13

### Quick things I should do in pieces every so often (ideally at least once every 10 days)

I searched the Slack self-chat logs for `lmlyd` and confirmed that
I've been doing the quick things often enough.

* Air conduction minimum audible volume and balance tests: recent
  executions on 2025-10-07, 2025-09-17, 2025-08-31, 2025-08-21,
  2025-08-16, 2025-07-27, 2025-07-20, 2025-07-05, and 2025-06-29.

* Bone conduction minimum audible volume and balance tests: recent
  executions on 2025-10-09, 2025-09-14, 2025-08-16, 2025-07-20,
  2025-07-09, 2025-07-06, 2025-06-29.

### More advanced portion of test with formal recording, that I should do formally at the periodic interval

    - I opened my eyes right at the end, to be greeted with an ad
    - I did a few redos and in some cases I opened my eyes earlier but when I followed the prior of not opening my eyes unless I felt a sudden stoppage of sound, I reproduced always opening at the end
    - Final frequency estimate: 20,000 Hz (no high-frequency hearing loss)
  - [x] Bone conduction headphones, start the video, setting volume to half the max
  - [x] Right before the GO point, put finger on space bar and fingers of right hand on volume controls, close eyes, note current time, and hit space bar

    - Final frequency estimate: around 15000-16000 Hz
