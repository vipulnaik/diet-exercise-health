# Vision checklist log

This is the execution log for the [vision
checklist](../checklists/vision-checklist.md).

## 2024-10-17

- Functional short distance vision test (computer reading): Try the exercise in https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/typing at 25% magnification and the usual eye-to-screen distance (17 to 25 inches, usually 20 to 23 inches)
  - [x] Both eyes at 25% magnification (threshold of 70 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
    - First score of 53 wpm was on a very unfamiliar passage; next two scores of 80 wpm and 79 wpm were more consistent with expectations
  - [x] Left eye only (right eye closed) at 75% magnification (threshold of 80 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
    - I think I scored around 89 wpm
  - [x] Right eye only (left eye closed) at 75% magnification
    - I think I scored around 94 wpm
- Functional slightly-longer distance vision test: Read vaseline and supplement bottle texts (30 to 35 inches)
  - [x] Both eyes
    - I was able to read supplement facts at about 40-60 inches, and the supplement name at 60-80 incues
  - [x] Left eye only
    - I was able to make out the general patterns of words but not necessarily read each letter (for instance, I could make out that it said "Store at something degrees celsius" but couldn't read the numerical value; words I could infer from the context)
  - [x] Right eye only
    - I could read rows like "Supplement facts" but not the individual rows under it at 40-60 inches
- Functional medium distance vision test: Try to read the FineDine and Craftsman packages at a distance of about 6 feet (basically, read them seated); start at a slight angle and then work my way to straight reading
  - [x] Both eyes
    - When viewed straight, I was able to read the main labels comfortably and the subtext a little slowly but still definitely; at a slight angle, I had trouble with some of the words
  - [x] Left eye only
    - Roughly similar to both eyes
  - [x] Right eye only
    - I seem to be having a bit more trouble with the subtext but it seems partly related to refocusing; however, I do suspect that my right eye vision is worse
- Functional long distance vision test: Verify that I can read a license plate for first parked car across the street when at intersection, assuming that the parked car leaves space for one car to allow turns (and see how much earlier I can read the license plate)
  - [x] Both eyes
  - [x] Left eye only
  - [x] Right eye only
    - Definitely more blurry than left eye at equivalent distance, but I was just about able to make things out except in cases of very similar letter/digit pairs

My overall assessment: both eyes are decent for short distance vision
and slightly-longer distance vision (up to 60 inches). Beyond the
60-inch (5 feet) mark, the left eye continues to be decent but the
right eye starts showing problems. This assessment is consistent with
the results of the most recent eye exam (see
https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2023/2023-10-04-eye-exam.md#examination-summary
for details).

Summary so far: The only change of note was that I seem to be having
trouble at 6 feet with my left eye only. I am planning to do further
tests at around that distance to get a clearer sense for how well I
can read at that distance.

- Functional short distance vision test (computer reading): Try the exercise in https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/typing at the usual eye-to-screen distance (17 to 25 inches, usually 20 to 23 inches)
  - [x] Both eyes at 25% magnification (threshold of 70 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
    - Scored 81 wpm
  - [x] Left eye only (right eye closed) at 75% magnification (threshold of 80 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
    - Scored 81 wpm
  - [x] Right eye only (left eye closed) at 75% magnification
    - Scored 90 wpm
- Functional slightly-longer distance vision test: Read vaseline and supplement bottle texts (30 to 35 inches)
  - [x] Both eyes
  - [x] Left eye only
  - NOTE: Keep both eyes open for about a minute before proceeding to the right eye; this helps with refocusing
  - [x] Right eye only
- Functional medium distance vision test: Try to read the FineDine and Craftsman packages at a distance of about 6 feet (basically, read them seated); start at a slight angle and then work my way to straight reading
  - [x] Both eyes
    - When viewed straight, I was able to read the main labels comfortably and the subtext a little slowly but still definitely; at a slight angle, I had trouble with some of the words
  - [x] Left eye only
    - This seemed much worse than both eyes -- I could not read some parts of the subtext even after staring at it for a while.
  - NOTE: Keep both eyes open for about a minute before proceeding to the right eye; this helps with refocusing
  - [x] Right eye only
    - Similar to and maybe even slightly worse than left eye
- Functional long distance vision test: Verify that I can read a license plate for first parked car across the street when at intersection, assuming that the parked car leaves space for one car to allow turns (and see how much earlier I can read the license plate)
  - [x] Both eyes
  - [x] Left eye only
  - [x] Right eye only
    - Definitely more blurry than left eye at equivalent distance, but I was just about able to make things out except in cases of very similar letter/digit pairs

My overall assessment: not much change since last time, except that I
might now have more issues with the left eye at the 6-foot mark. I
will retest the left eye at the 6-foot mark in a few days.

UPDATE 2025-01-01: So, I confirmed that I was able to read the
subtexts at the 6-foot mark with the left eye, though it does seem
worse than both eyes. It's still better than the right
eye. Considering that I haven't noticed changes at distances other
than around the 6-foot mark, I may do a bit more focused practice of
reading things in the 6-to-10-foot range more.

## 2025-06-25

My overall assessment is that the short distance vision remains
intact, but increasing to medium distance, about 5 to 6 feet, my
vision appears to have deteriorated compared to last time. But it may
be that the light level was less during this test than the previous
test (which is less of an issue for computer screens because they emit
their own light). I did see some improvement when I turned the light
on for medium distance vision tests, but I feel it still fell short of
previous tests.

- Functional short distance vision test (computer reading): Try the exercise in https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/typing at the usual eye-to-screen distance (17 to 25 inches, usually 20 to 23 inches)
  - [x] Both eyes at 25% magnification (threshold of 70 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
    - 65 wpm, 51 wpm, 78 wpm, 65 wpm, 79 wpm, 80 wm
    - For comparison, both eyes at 75% (my usual setting) gave scores of 90 wpm and 108 wpm
  - [x] Left eye only (right eye closed) at 75% magnification (threshold of 80 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
    - 86 wpm, 80 wpm, 82 wpm, 95 wpm, 90 wpm
  - [x] Right eye only (left eye closed) at 75% magnification (threshold of 80 wpm on at heast one of three attempts)
    - 93 wpm, 93 wpm, 98 wpm, 91 wpm, 97 wpm
- Functional slightly-longer distance vision test: Read vaseline and supplement bottle texts (30 to 35 inches)
  - [x] Both eyes
    - Able to read Ca/Mg/Zn comfortably, vaseline bottle very slowly
  - [x] Left eye only
    - Slightly harder than both eyes but roughly able to read the same stuff
  - NOTE: Keep both eyes open for about a minute before proceeding to the right eye; this helps with refocusing
  - [x] Right eye only
    - Definitely harder than the left eye but I could just about do it
- Functional medium distance vision test: Try to read the FineDine and Craftsman packages at a distance of about 6 feet (basically, read them seated); start at a slight angle and then work my way to straight reading
  - [x] Both eyes
    - It took me a while from a straight view, and putting the light on helped. I think this has deteriorated since last time.
  - [x] Left eye only
    - It took me a while from a straight view, and putting the light on helped. I think this has deteriorated since last time.
  - NOTE: Keep both eyes open for about a minute before proceeding to the right eye; this helps with refocusing
  - [x] Right eye only
