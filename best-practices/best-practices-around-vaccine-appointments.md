# Best practices around vaccine appointments

## Tally check

See [best practices around medical
appointments](best-practices-around-medical-appointments.md) for
general principles informing these best practices.

The main things specific to vaccine appointments are local strain at
the site of administration, which is the arm muscle, and therefore
also increased strain in the arm and neck muscles.

Of the principles listed in the document, the following are
inapplicable and hence omitted:

* (regional IM pre / cyclic personal chores load): The timing of
  vaccines is often in the winter due to peak infectious season
  reasons, even though that is also the period when cyclic personal
  chores load is maximum. All other considerations under "local IM
  pre" and "regional IM pre" are covered above.

* (preparation / accuracy of testing): There is no "testing" element
  to vaccines, it's a treatment. So accuracy of testing is not needed
  per se.

## Use the calendar reminder as the date of booking

The calendar reminders have been selected to allow for a reasonable
cadence and so that the times are reasonable in terms of weather
conditions, cadence of vaccination, and relationship with peak
infection cycles. However, the time of vaccination may need to be
adjusted based on factors such as the following:

* Current or upcoming travel that makes it difficult to get the vaccination

* Travel or other high-risk activity that makes it beneficial to delay
  getting the vaccination to have peak immunity during the high-risk
  activity

## Booking process

### Date selection

* (local IM pre / book in advance) Booking about 1-3 weeks in advance
  is ideal. However, in some cases, there may be significant backlogs
  and it may only be possible to book 3+ weeks in advance.

* (local IM pre / good time of day and day of week; recovery / general
  energy conservation): Preferable date / time: Friday 3 PM (but
  confirm free on both personal and work calendar); this minimizes
  interference with my day job and the time is usually free. Another
  reason to do Friday rather than Wednesday is that vaccines impose
  greater recovery costs than many other medical procedures, so having
  a vaccine on a Friday allows for less interference with day job
  during the recovery process.

* (local IM pre / free time; regional IM pre / busyness) Check for
  appointments and other commitments on the day of booking or the two
  days after booking. Two days after is important because recovery
  from vaccines can take up to two days.

* (local IM pre / weather; regional IM pre / weather) Check the
  weather conditions around the time of booking: In particular, avoid
  days of rain forecast (if possible), or days when it is unusually
  hot or cold

* (regional IM pre / travel + medical) Try to select a time with
  nothing of this sort in the preceding or following two weeks:

  * Ill health of any sort

  * Medical appointments such as eye care appointments, other tests, or
    dental cleaning appointments

  * Intercity travel

  * Unusually high-stress events

### Booking steps

* Book on the website such as Walgreens. Make sure that the location,
  date, and selected vaccine are correct. Double-check all entered
  information.

* After booking, fill in consent forms and other related
  information. This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done
  on-location.

* Review the email received for details such as what to carry, when to
  arrive.

* (local IM post / mark-on-calendar) Add the vaccine appointment to
  the calendar, with the calendar event starting 2.5 hours prior to
  the appointment time and ending 2.5 hours after the appointment
  time. Invite my work email address as well so that the time range
  shows as blocked on the work calendar as well.

  The actual appointment time should be noted in the calendar event. I
  should aim to arrive at the location about 10 minutes prior to the
  reporting time (which is generally 15 minutes prior to the
  appointment, so in total it's 25 minutes prior to the appointment).

## Calendar reminders and other preparation

Add the following calendar reminders.

### ASAP after the appointment date and time are confirmed

* (local IM post / on-call) Maintenance windows for work alerts where
  I'm primary: I can set these up when the appointment time is
  confirmed. Generally, set the maintenance window to start four hours
  prior to the start and end four hours after the end.

* (local IM post / on-call) Overrides for me for services where I
  rotate with others: Try for the override to be a full-day override;
  if a full day isn't possible, try covering at least two hours prior
  to the start and three hours after the end of the appointment.

* (local IM post / calendar) Work calendar events and Slack
  reminders: I should clear out as much as possible, and then after
  that be particularly careful in the 2-3 days leading up to the
  appointment to keep that day clear.

### (local IM post / cyclic personal chores) Shopping reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Carrying heavy grocery bags can be a challenge after getting a sore
arm due to a vaccine.

### (local IM post / weather check) Weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Set a weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment.

### Reminders to pause and resume strength exercises and hand gripper exercises

* (preparation / local rest; preparation / risk reduction) Pause
  reminder for strength exercises and hand gripper exercises: Two days
  prior to the vaccine appointment

  Rationale: the vaccine is injected intramuscularly (in the muscle),
  generally in the arm muscle. Generally, strength exercises and hand
  gripper exercises cause wear and tear of the muscles and the
  recovery from this wear and tear can take 1-2 days. By pausing
  strength exercises for two days prior to the vaccine, I increase the
  chances that my arm muscles are fully recovered at the time of the
  vaccine.

* (recovery / local rest + reduced capacity + increased injury risk)
  Resume reminder for hand gripper exercise in the non-vaccine arm:
  Four days after the vaccine appointment

  Rationale: the vaccine is administrated intramuscularly in the arm
  muscle, which can create a stress not just on the muscle in that
  arm, but for muscles in the neck area that serves both arms. Tensing
  the other arm can interact with that stress and cause more pain, so
  it's safest to pause anything that will unnecessarily tense that
  other arm.

* (recovery / local rest + reduced capacity + increased injury risk)
  Resume reminder for hand gripper exercise in the vaccine arm: Seven
  days after the vaccine appointment

* (recovery / local rest + reduced capacity + increased injury
  risk) Resume reminder for strength exercises: Nine days after the
  vaccine appointment

* (recovery / documentation and processing) Reminder to update
  internal records: One day after the vaccine appointment:

  * Finish documentation in the file about the vaccination

  * Include in the year's activity tracker and link from the activity
    tracker to the doc

  * Add to [vaccine_administrations.sql](../sql/vaccine_administrations.sql)

  * Update most recent vaccine date for that condition in the
    [infectious diseases and vaccines section of the health
    profile](../profile-information/health-profile.md#infectious-diseases-and-vaccines)

* (recovery / documentation and processing) Reminder to check vaccine
  records: Four days after the vaccine appointment; if the record is
  not yet available, then remind again after three more days:

  * Walgreens website for a digital record

  * https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/ for an updated record of all
    recent vaccines received in California

### Reminders to pause and resume jogging and breath holds

* (preparation / general energy conservation) Pause reminder: morning
  of the vaccine if it's in the afternoon; one day prior if it's in
  the morning

* (recovery / general energy conservation) Resume reminder
  (conditional to feeling well): three days after the vaccine

### (preparation / direct) Packing / prep reminder for the night before the appointment

Anything I need to get ready for the vaccine appointment should
ideally be handled the previous night, so that even if I'm in a rush I
don't miss doing it. This includes any planning for additional things
I hope to do in the trip after the appointment.

### (preparation / direct; recovery / documentation and processing) Make a document in `events/<year>` titled `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug for vaccine dose>.md`

Follow the structure of previous documents of this sort. Note any
special considerations or thoughts beyond just the execution of the
instructions in this best practices doc. This is the document that I
will continue to update and expand upon over time, with the bulk of
the expansion happening after the vaccine appointment.
