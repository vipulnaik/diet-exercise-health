# Best practices around urination and fluid intake

This is a stub to be expanded later.

Key urination params and values for me in daytime:

* minimum duration after urination to be able to pass urine again if
  needed: 0 to 90 minutes

* difference between normal adjacent urinations when not trying to
  hold urine for too long and not proactively trying to void: 90 to
  180 minutes

* how long I can hold urine with moderate effort if needed: 180 to 360
  minutes

Lower urine production rate at night, higher when colder all else
equal, higher after meals and in the early morning
