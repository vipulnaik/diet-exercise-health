# Best practices around audiological evaluation appointments

## Tally check

See [best practices around medical
appointments](best-practices-around-medical-appointments.md) for
general principles informing these best practices.

The main things specific to vaccine appointments are local strain at
the site of administration, which is the arm muscle, and therefore
also increased strain in the arm and neck muscles.

Of the principles listed in the document, the following are
inapplicable and hence omitted:

* (preparation / accuracy of testing) As of the time of writing this
  document, I am not aware of specific things I need to do ahead of
  the appointment for more accurate testing. However, I should make
  sure to not do unusual things that put added strain on my ears (but
  these are things I would not normally do anyway).

* (preparation / local rest) As of the time of writing this document,
  I am not aware of specific tings I need to do ahead of the
  appointment to rest my ears. However, I should make sure to not do
  unusual things that put added strain on my ears (but these are
  things I would not normally do anyway).

* (preparation / risk reduction) I don't have a good model of things
  where the audiological evaluation might create or amplify specific
  risks.

* (recovery / general energy conservation) I don't expect the
  appointment to be fatiguing in any subtle / non-obvious ways, so I
  don't need a recovery period. If I do feel fatigued after the
  appointment, I may take a break from exercise but that will be on a
  case-by-case basis.

* (recovery / local rest + reduced capacity + increased injury risk) I
  don't expect to need to rest my ears after the appointment. With
  that said, I will double-check based on the specific procedures done
  whether I need to rest my ears a little bit.

## Booking process

### Figure out the right time range I want my appointment and book about 3 weeks in advance of that time

As of the time of writing this document, I book my audiological
evaluation appointments with the [Berkeley Hearing
Center](https://berkeleyhearing.com/) (see their [audiological
evaluation
page](https://berkeleyhearing.com/services/audiological-evaluation/)). Appointments
are generally booked out about 2-4 weeks in advance. Pick a suitable
appointment date about 3 weeks or so later.

* (local IM pre / good time of day and day of week) Generally, prefer
  to book Wednesday appointments; if Wednesday is not available, book
  a Friday appointment.

* (local IM pre / free time; regional IM pre / busyness) Check for
  appointments and other commitments on the day of booking as well as
  general busyness around that time.

* (local IM pre / weather) (regional IM pre / weather) and (regional
  IM pre / cyclic personal chores load) In general, prefer to book an
  appointment during the summer when it's raining less and my cyclic
  personal chores load is low, but if there are specific hearing
  issues I want diagnosed, I should book the appointment even if it's
  winter time.

* (regional IM pre / travel + medical) Try to select a time with
  nothing of this sort in the preceding or following two weeks:

  * Ill health of any sort

  * Medical appointments such as eye care appointments, other tests, or
    dental cleaning appointments

  * Intercity travel

  * Unusually high-stress events

### Booking steps

* (local IM pre / book in advance) Book the appointment by calling the
  Berkeley Hearing Center phone number 510-841-0681 during their
  working hours (Monday to Friday 9 AM to 5 PM) about 3 or more weeks
  prior to my target appointment date. Take notes of the time agreed
  upon in the call. Make sure they get my email address and phone
  number correct -- it should already be on file from my previous
  booking of
  [2024-12-23](../events/2024/2024-12-23-berkeley-hearing-center-call.md).

* Right after the phone call, I should receive an email link to an
  intake form. Fill in the intake form. The process may change a bit
  for subsequent appointments; the intake form was needed for the
  first appointment and I'm not sure it'll be exactly the same for
  followup appointments.

* After submitting the intake form, verify that I received an email
  confirming the appointment date and time, and that this appointment
  date and time matches the appointment date and time I have in my
  notes from the phone call.

* (local IM post / mark-on-calendar) Add the audiological evaluation
  appointment to the calendar, with the calendar event starting 2
  hours 45 minutes prior to the appointment start time and ending 2
  hours after the appointment end time. Appointments with Berkeley
  Hearing Center seem to be for 1 hour 15 minutes, so this calendar
  event is expected to be for 6 hours.

  The actual appointment time should be noted in the calednar event. I
  should aim to arrive at the location about 25 minutes prior to the
  appointment start time.

## Calendar reminders and other preparation

### ASAP after the appointment date and time are confirmed

* (local IM post / on-call) Maintenance windows for work alerts where
  I'm primary: I can set these up when the appointment time is
  confirmed. Generally, set the maintenance window to start four hours
  prior to the start and end four hours after the end.

* (local IM post / on-call) Overrides for me for services where I
  rotate with others: Try for the override to be a full-day override;
  if a full day isn't possible, try covering at least two hours prior
  to the start and three hours after the end of the appointment.

* (local IM post / calendar) Work calendar events and Slack
  reminders: I should clear out as much as possible, and then after
  that be particularly careful in the 2-3 days leading up to the
  appointment to keep that day clear.

### (local IM post / cyclic personal chores) Shopping reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Try to get as much shopping done before the appointment so that I
don't need to go shopping on the day of the appointment.

### (local IM post / weather check) Weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Set a weather check reminder for two days prior to the
appointment. Most likely, I will keep the appointment even in case of
slight rain, given the long lag time to getting another
appointment. However, in case of severe weather issues I might
reschedule the appointment.

### (preparation / direct) Reminder to do at-home digital hearing tests two days prior to the appointment (if not done within the past week)

Digital hearing tests are part of my checklist of items to do once
every 2 months. But, I should make sure to do such a test shortly
before the evaluation so that I can compare my at-home results and
those of the formal evaluation. With that said, if I am booking the
audiological evaluation to debug a recent hearing issue, I may be
doing the digital hearing tests more frequently anyway, and have
calendar reminders for that already, in which case I don't need a
separate reminder.

### (preparation / direct) Packing / prep reminder for the night before the appointment

Anything I need to get ready for the audiological evaluation
appointment should ideally be handled the previous night, so that even
if I'm in a rush I don't miss doing it. This includes any planning for
additional things I hope to do in the trip after the appointment.

### (preparation / general energy conservation) Skip all exercise on the day of the appointment

Skipping all exercise on the day of the appointment makes sure that I
am well-rested for the appointment, and also allows me to make up for
some of the time lost in the appointment.

### (preparation / direct; recovery / documentation and processing) Make a document in `events/<year>` titled `<YYYY-MM-DD>-audiological-evaluation.md`

Follow the structure of previous documents of this sort. Note any
special considerations or thoughts beyond just the execution of the
instructions in this best practices doc. This is the document that I
will continue to update and expand upon over time, with the bulk of
the expansion happening after the audiological evaluation appointment.

For documentation, a few things to make sure to cover in addition to
writing the document itself:

* Include in the year's activity tracker and link from the activity
  tracker to the doc
* Add row to [doctor_visits.sql](../sql/doctor_visits.sql)
* Update latest audiological evaluation link in
  [health-profile.md](../profile-information/health-profile.md)
