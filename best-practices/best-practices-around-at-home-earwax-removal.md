# Best practices around at-home earwax removal

This document is based on two experiences:

* [2024-12-24 overnight into 2024-12-25](../events/2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md#research-on-and-efforts-toward-earwax-removal-on-2024-12-24)
* [2025-12-25 overnight into 2025-12-26](../events/2025/2025-12-22-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md#recurrence-again-on-2025-12-25-and-use-of-digital-otoscope-for-photos-and-ear-wax-md-for-earwax-removal)

As of the time of initial writing of this document (2025-12-26):

* I have only done it in one ear, namely the left ear. The logistics
  and experience may be a little different for the right ear.

* I don't yet have clarity on how often to repeat and what the
  experience is like if I do this regularly.

## Topical treatment protocol best practices answers

Below are answers and related thoughts on prompts from the [best
practices around adding a topical treatment protocol
document](best-practices-around-adding-a-topical-treatment-protocol.md).

* If there are different strengths and formulations, the difference
  between them: I watched some of the videos above to compare
  different formulations. Sodium bicarbonate (the main ingredient of
  Ear Wax MD, which is what I am applying) is among the more
  effective, but may be unwise to apply frequently. The hope is that I
  make significant progress with the first application.

* Expected dose range: My plan is to limit myself to a single tube,
  and squeeze as much of it as I need to till my left ear feels full.

* Frequency range: I will limit to at most once a week in any given
  ear, and I should ideally target about once every 2 months per ear
  in steady state. The more frequent application should only be in
  cases where I suspect significant earwax buildup.

* Minimum and maximum dose gap: Minimum gap of 1 week.

* Impact of missing a dose -- is it advisable to double-dose, or just
  contine with other doses regularly? Don't double-dose.

* Any dependence or tolerance effects that are known: I'm not yet
  planning to do this often enough for such effects to become a
  concern.

Timing information: Based on the how-to, this is most convenient to do
before a bath so that it can make up for any shortfall in the
irrigation process.

Risk of getting in eyes: My plan is to keep my eyes closed during the
squeezing process. If for whatever reason something does get in my
eyes, it looks like the priority will be to flush the eyes for a
lengthy period of time, and forgo the earwax removal benefits for this
time.

Risk of getting on hands: The tube structure means that there
shouldn't be stuff getting on hands. Even so, I'll keep towels
handy to wipe my hands, and if a lot gets on hands I may again have to
abandon the earwax removal plan and focus on washing my hands first.

Other parts of the skin: My plan is to wipe off minor amounts that get
on the skin, but if a lot gets on and it's itching and burning, then
cleaning it up takes priority over earwax removal.

## Things to check and plan during the day

### Supplies checks

I should make sure of the following:

* I should have a tube of Ear Wax MD to apply.

* I should have the Walgreens earwax removal kit.

* I should have at least two clean hand towels / dish towels that I
  can expend on this (without disrupting dish towel availability for
  dishes).

### Timing

I should do the earwax removal application at night, before my bath
but after brushing teeth. The whole process end-to-end takes about an
hour, so I need to close for sleep about an hour prior to when I
normally would do so for a given target time of actually going to
sleep. My normal gap between closing for sleep and going to sleep is
about 1 hour, so essentially I would need to close for sleep about 2
hours before going to sleep.

Depending on the rest of my schedule for the day, this may rule out
some possibilities for things to do later in the day. For instance,
unless I have my dinner (second meal) really early, I probably can't
do laundry after dinner.

## Quick hearing tests within about 1 to 2 hours prior to starting

I should do the quick minimum audible volume and balance tests about 1
to 2 hours prior to starting. Ideally, I can do them during the night
checklist execution before I close for sleep.

## Preparatory steps

After I have brushed my teeth, I should begin preparation.

### Specific preparation

* Prep by placing hand towels on top of my pillow so that I lie down
  on these, so that any earwax discharge lands on the hand towels and
  I can also use these to wipe my ear

* Prep by separating the earwax tube I intend to apply from the rest

* Prep by having the earwax removal syringe kit handy

### Other auxiliary preparation

* Wash my feet

* Remove my sweatshirt

* Keep my scrunchy on so that hair don't fall on my ear

* Make sure I have surfaces to put stuff on while lying down (for
  instance, paper towel on window sill if somewhat dirty)

* Turn a light on that provides enough illumination but not too much

* Make sure my trash can is accessible from my bed while I am lying
  down, so I can throw the tube after it's done

* Put my socks in the laundry and take out a fresh pair of socks for
  use after ear drop application

## Application and irrigation process

### Application process

* With the phone and tube in front of me, lie down on the side
  opposite the ear I intend to apply Ear Wax MD in

* (Checkpoint in Slack self-chat logs) Start the phone timer for 20
  minutes

* Remove the tube cap, move it to above the ear, rotate it toward the
  ear, and begin; keep holding the cap with the other hand

* Apply the Ear Wax MD a few seconds at a time (apply for 2 seconds,
  wait for 5 seconds or so until I feel ready for the next
  application), keep the tube on top of the ear during the mini-breaks
  in application; if I need a longer break, rotate the tube upward,
  move it away, and cap it

* (Checkpoint in Slack self-chat logs) Cap and throw away the tube
  once it is used (the process of application should take about 5 to
  10 minutes)

* (Checkpoint start and end in Slack self-chat logs) Once I feel wax
  bubbling to the surface of the ear, wipe the ear with the edge of
  the hand towel / dish towel while I continue to lie down, but gently
  and without pressing stuff inward; there should be a peak period of
  about 2 to 5 minutes when most of the wax comes out

* When the phone timer reaches 20 minutes, add another 10 minutes

* (Checkout in Slack self-chat logs) When 30 minutes are up, get out
  of bed

### Irrigation process

* Get the Walgreens ear wax removal kit out

* When filling the syringe, use a temperature setting halfway between
  normal and hot; this is close to body temperature

* Fit the tube on the syringe and squirt into the ear

* Repeat the process 5 to 10 times

* If more earwax seems to be coming out, wipe this additional earwax
  with the hand towel / dish towel (use areas that don't already have
  earwax)

* Wash the syringe and tube with soap and water and leave them to dry

### Towel photos and cleaning

* Take photos of the earwax stains on the towels, ideally identifying
  which photos are of earwax removed at which stage

* Wash the earwax stains on the towels with soap and water and put the
  towels in the laundry for a full wash

* Upload the photos to Google Drive

## Quick hearing tests after irrigation

I should do the quick minimum audible volume and balance tests within
about 30 minutes after irrigation.

## Next day documentation

* Fill in documentation the next day

* Copy the photos over to GitHub
