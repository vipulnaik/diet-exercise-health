# Best practices around dental cleaning appointments

## Tally check

See [best practices around medical
appointments](best-practices-around-medical-appointments.md) for
general principles informing these best practices.

The main things specific to vaccine appointments are local strain at
the site of administration, which is the arm muscle, and therefore
also increased strain in the arm and neck muscles.

Of the principles listed in the document, the following are
inapplicable and hence omitted:

* (local IM pre / weather) The appointment is booked far enough in
  advance that I don't have clarity on the weather conditions. With
  that said, the current cadence (April and October) is decent for
  Berkeley weather.

* (local IM post / weather check) The 72-hour cancellation notice
  means that I can't do a 2-day weather check to influence my
  appointment.

* (regional IM pre / busyness) The appointment is booked far enough in
advance that I don't have clarity on my level of busyness.

* (regional IM pre / travel + medical) The appointment is booked too
  far in advance for this to factor in, but if travel and medical
  plans come up, I would factor those in and reschedule the
  appointment.

* (regional IM pre / cyclic personal chores load) ) The appointment is
  booked far enough in advance that I don't have clarity on my level
  of cyclic personal chores load.

* (regional IM pre / weather) The appointment is booked far enough in
  advance that I don't have clarity on the weather conditions. With
  that said, the current cadence (April and October) is decent for
  Berkeley weather.

* (preparation / accuracy of testing) Nothing special is needed beyond
  my ongoing usual dental hygiene (though we can think of some of the
  cautions around intense and hard foods as being sort-of-related, but
  they fall under risk reduction).

* (preparation / local rest) No particular local rest is needed prior
  to the appointment.

* (recovery / general energy conservation) No specific recovery is
  needed in a typical case.

## (local IM post / mark-on-calendar) Note the appointment date and time

(local IM pre / book in advance)
(local IM pre / free time)
(local IM pre / good time of day and day of week)

I generally book my dental cleaning appointment as part of the
previous dental cleaning appointment, and the usual interval is 27
weeks. My booking preference is Wednesday 1 PM.

Note the appointment date and time in the notes for the previous
appointment, and also put a calendar reminder. The start time for the
calendar reminder should be 2.5 hours before the appointment time and
the end time should be 3.5 hours after the appointment time (as the
appointments are for one hour, this means 2.5 hours after the end of
the appointment). Invite my work email address as well so that the
time range shows as blocked on the work calendar as well.

Also, check the two weeks before and after it just to make sure that I
don't have anything else that could create a conflict, such as travel,
other medical appointments, vaccines, or blood tests.

## Calendar reminders around the event

### Reminder to review maintenance windows, work calendar events, and Slack alert for work stuff (two weeks prior) -- put on work calendar

* (local IM post / on-call) Maintenance windows for work alerts where
  I'm primary: I can set these up when the appointment time is
  confirmed (usually six months prior) but should review two weeks
  prior as there may be changes to the list of affected
  services. Generally, set the maintenance window to start at 9 PM the
  previous night and end five hours after the start (so four hours
  after the end). Also include in the maintenance window any services
  with 24 X 7 notification, with the exception of services that I have
  good reason to exclude.

* (local IM post / on-call) Overrides for me for services where I
  rotate with others: I should probably handle these about two weeks
  prior to the appointment. Try for the override to be a full-day
  override; if a full day isn't possible, try covering at least two
  hours prior to the start and four hours after the end of the
  appointment.

* (local IM post / calendar) Work calendar events and Slack reminders:
  At the two-week-prior mark, I should clear out as much as possible,
  and then after that be particularly careful in the 2-3 days leading
  up to the appointment to keep that day clear.

### (preparation / risk reduction) Total three calendar events with reminders to pause and resume consumption of sauerkraut, walnuts, lemons, and spicy foods

* Reminder for two weeks prior to the appointment:

  * Phase out cayenne pepper in prepared food: It should be half of
    usual quantity for preparations between two weeks and one week
    before the appointment, and zero for preparations within one ween
    before the appointment.

  * Stop having kimchi if I have an open bottle; don't open a new
    bottle: I should pause kimchi consumption starting two weeks prior
    to the appointment.

  * Don't have hot food in isolation: When consuming recently prepared
    hot food, I should make sure to mix it with cooler liquid foods so
    that the hottest temperature in my mouth isn't too high (this is a
    good practice in general but I should be particularly careful in
    the run-up to a dental cleaning appointment).

  * Decide (and set a reminder if the decision is positive) whether to
    pausing sauerkraut about a week prior to the appointment in case
    of existing or recent mouth ulcers: If I currently have mouth
    ulcers, or have had them recently, consider pausing sauerkraut
    about a week prior to the dental cleaning. NOTE: Further
    information gleaned through the execution of the dental self-exam
    checklist one week before the dental cleaning may lead me to
    modify the decision.

  * Decide (and set a reminder if the decision is positive) whether to
    pause walnuts about 5-6 days prior to the appointmentif I have had
    mouth ulcers or recent mouth bites: appointment. However, when
    pausing walnuts, I should review my calorie, fiber,
    polyunsaturated fat, and protein intakes to make sure that
    stopping these will not result in a significant drop. NOTE: Further
    information gleaned through the execution of the dental self-exam
    checklist one week before the dental cleaning may lead me to
    modify the decision.

* Reminder for the morning of the appointment: Skip sauerkraut and
  walnuts, to reduce the risk of mouth bites or irritation right
  before the appointment.

* Reminder after the appointment to decide regarding resuming foods:

  * If I notice any injuries in the mouth, or I have had recent mouth
    ulcers or mouth bites, I should keep the pauses on for a few days
    (resume in order of walnuts, then sauerkraut, then cayenne
    peepper, kimchi, etc.).

  * If none of the above conditions apply, I can resume immediately
    (walnuts on the evening of, sauerkraut the next morning, and
    cayenne pepper with any meal prep at least two days out).

### (preparation / direct) Reminder to execute the dental self-exam checklist one week prior to the appointment

The reminder is to execute the [dental self-exam
checklist](../checklists/dental-self-exam-checklist.md) and log it as
usual in the [logs](../logs/dental-self-exam-checklist-log.md).

I should do this about one week prior to the dental cleaning. The
reason to do it sufficiently in advance is two-fold:

* If there is new information I learn, I can do further research on
  it, and take additional precautions, before the dental cleaning.

* If the pressure testing reveals and exacerbates pain and
  inflammation that I didn't know about, I have enough time for
  recovery before the dental cleaning.

### (preparation / direct) Cancellation consideration for three business days before the appointment

There is a $50 charge for cancelling less than three business days
prior to the appointment, so I should set a calendar reminder to
consider whether to cancel or reschedule while I can still do so for
free. In particular, other related stuff such as vaccines, blood
tests, or travel plans may come up.

Some of the things to consider:

* Do I have any kind of injuries in my mouth that I expect to not
  represent chronic problems but rather temporary injuries?
  Rescheduling to a week later makes sense in such cases.

* Am I feeling unwell, for instance, digestive issues, minor cold,
  sniffling, etc.? In such cases, if there is an expected trajectory
  of getting better, delaying by 1-2 weeks, based on the expected
  trajectory, would be desirable.

* Look carefully in my calendar for the next few weeks and make sure
  there's nothing of concern in the two weeks ahead of the dental
  cleaning appointment.

### (local IM post / cyclic personal chores) Shopping reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Set up a reminder for a grocery shopping trip for the evening two days
before the dental cleaning appointment. It's good to have groceries
shopped for ahead of the appointment if possible.

### (preparation / risk reduction) Reminder to keep fermentable food consumption to a minimum starting 24 hours prior to the appointment

In particular, this includes peas and lentils. I might have a bit of
sauerkraut with the first meal the day prior to the appointment (which
would fall just about 24 hours before the appointment) but shouldn't
go overboard on the sauerkraut. The goal is to reduce the risk of
flatulence and abdominal discomfort during the dental cleaning
process. My target threshold is more strict (I want to avoid abdominal
discomfort more completely) given the nature of the process and the
extended confinement.

### (preparation / direct) Reminder to do normal face shaving 1 or 2 days prior to appointment and discard razor used

I don't want to be in a situation where I have a lot of face shaving
to do the morning of the appointment, so I should make sure not to
skip normal face shaving 1 or 2 days prior. Also, discard the razor when done so that I have a fresh razor for the shaving the morning of the appointment.

### (preparation / direct) Packing / prep reminder for the night before the appointment

Anything I need to get ready for the dental cleaning should ideally be
handled the previous night, so that even if I'm in a rush I don't miss
doing it. This includes any planning for additional things I hope to
do in the trip after the appointment.

### (preparation / direct) Reminder to do thorough face shaving between 3 and 6 hours prior to the appointment (using a new razor)

Shave slowly and thoroughly. Be particularly thorough and careful in
the area above and below the lips.

### (preparation / general energy conservation) Reminder to skip exercise on the day of the appointment

This is to conserve time and energy for the appointment.

### (recovery / documentation and processing) Reminder to document the dental cleaning on the evening of the cleaning

I should document the dental cleaning as soon as I can.

If I don't even have time to fully document the dental cleaning, I
should note key points to myself to be fleshed out later.

For documentation, a few things to make sure to cover in addition to
writing the document itself:

* Include in the year's activity tracker and link from the activity
  tracker to the doc
* Add row to [doctor_visits.sql](../sql/doctor_visits.sql)
* Update latest dental cleaning link in
  [health-profile.md](../profile-information/health-profile.md)

### Reminder to set reminders for the next dental cleaning appointment

Set a reminder for the evening of the dental cleaning appointment to
set calendar reminders for the next dental cleaning appointment
following this doc.

### (recovery / local rest + reduced capacity + increased injury risk) Reminder to check for head and neck soreness the day after the appointment and skip strength exercises / hand gripper exercises if there is soreness

Sometimes, the ergonomics of the dental cleaning appointment may cause
or exacerbate head and neck soreness. Although mild, this can be
exacerbated by strength exercises and hand gripper exercises. Check
the day after the appointment and consider skipping these exercises in
case of observed soreness.

### (recovery / local rest + reduced capacity + increased injury risk) Reminder to drink plenty of water and keep my talking load low for the two days after the appointment (to minimize and better address the risk of excess salivation)

I should closely monitor my saliva levels for the two days after the
appointment.

Drinking plenty of water helps address the risk of dry mouth.

Keeping my talking load low may help reduce excess salivation and also
reduce the inconvenience imposed by excess salivation.

### (recovery / documentation and processing) Reminder to execute dental self-exam checklist one week after the cleaning

The reminder is to execute the [dental self-exam
checklist](../checklists/dental-self-exam-checklist.md) and log it as
usual in the [logs](../logs/dental-self-exam-checklist-log.md), then
also document the dental cleaning event itself.
A time of 1 week is to give the teeth and gums time to recover from
any trauma, inflammation, or excess salivary response they experienced
as a result of the cleaning, and also to spread out the time effort
because things are likely anyway hectic after the dental cleaning.

It's okay to delay the dental self-exam checklist by up to 1 more week
after the 1 week (total of 2 weeks). 2 weeks is about the timeframe
within which I don't expect significant changes, so that it should
still be a reasonable approximation to the starting state of my teeth
after the cleaning. Delaying further runs the risk of picking up
plaque accumulation and staining after the cleaning.


## Things to keep in mind during the appointment

* Make sure I know the signal to use with the hygienist to communicate
  if I have pain or need the cleaning to be stopped or paused.

* Don't keep the mouth open too wide for too long. In particular,
  close it for brief intervals in between when the hygienist is not
  working on the mouth. Keeping the mouth open for too long can
  trigger excess salivation the next day.
