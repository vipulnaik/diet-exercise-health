# TODO list

List last updated: 2025-12-27

This document covers a list of things I need to do for my health, outside of:

* Normal exercise and health-related work embedded in my daily or
  multi-day routine (such as dental care)

* Stuff covered in month change checklists, such as vision, hearing,
  and dental checklists

It includes investigations, documentation updates, tests (blood, DEXA,
urine, etc.), regular appointments (eye, ear, dental, etc.), and
one-off / special tests.

Time on these things would be in a mix of personal chores and other
activities buckets. The other activities bucket would be used for
general learning, including watching YouTube videos. The personal
chores bucket would be for focused work for my own health, including
best practices documentation, event logging, purchasing supplements
and tests, going to get the tests, documenting the results, etc.

The work can further be classified as time-sensitive (triggered by
currently occurring issues) versus non-time-sensitive (most other
exploratory stuff). The (personal chores bucket, non-time-sensitive)
stuff I generally try to do on weekdays only. The other buckets I can
do on weekdays or weekends. The other activities bucket stuff is
limited to 2 hours per day as it falls under POCS; see [best practices
around exertion and
stimulation](../best-practices/best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation.md).

My goal is to be sufficiently forward-thinking with this list that I
investigate and consolidate knowledge before it becomes
time-sensitive.

## Investigations into health conditions

* Investigate lipid-lowering strategies (focused on LDL and Apo
  B). Notes [here](lipid-lowering-strategies.md).

## Documentation updates and catch-up (excluding best practices documents)

I am giving myself multi-week buffers for the execution of these
keeping in mind that other things can come up and I may not be able to
work on these. I expect that the actual work should not take more than
a few hours each. As per my general philosophy, I should aim to limit
my work on these to weekdays (so if a given week is busy on weekdays,
I might defer to the next week). I'm free to make faster progress if I
can stick to weekdays!

* Continue investigating my hearing and earwax situation (off and on
  over December 2025 / January 2026, with initial focused effort in
  the wek of 2025-12-22)

* Finish data entry for blood tests done 2025-09-10 (CBC, health
  profile updates, and final checking remain) (current plan is weeks
  of 2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19)

* Conceptualize and enter data for DEXA scan results (current plan is
  weeks of 2026-01-26 and 2026-02-02)

* Add details on my hair (receding hairline) situation (as a new
  section in my health profile) (current plan is weeks of 2026-02-09
  and 2026-02-16)

* Look into 23andMe MTHFR stuff and methylated B vitamin investigation
  in connection with homocysteine analysis (current plan is week of
  2026-02-23)

## Regular appointments / procedures (things I have done before and have a decent handle on the process for)

These likely don't require any investigation, but I am including them
in this document as they may constrain the time available for the
other things I do need to investigate.

It's generally best to keep a gap of at least 3 weeks between these
and to try to schedule them when I am not on-call.

* COVID vaccine (likely late January 2026)

* Earwax removal appointment (likely February or March 2026)

* Blood tests plus maybe urine test (likely late March 2026); see
  [2026-blood-test-plans-round-1.md](../events/2026/2026-blood-test-plans-round-1.md)
  for more information

* Dental cleaning (already scheduled for 2026-04-29); see
  [2026-04-29-deental-cleaning.md](../events/2026/2026-04-29-dental-cleaning.md)
  for more information

* Eye exam (likely May 2026)

* DEXA scan (not decided, but maybe in July/August 2026)

## Special appointments / procedures (things I have not done before and don't have a handle on the procedure for, so I may or may not do)

I will likely not start looking into doing these until May 2026, but I
should continue to learn more in the "other activities" time
(listening to and watching videos while multiplexing with eating,
cooking, or post-meal cleanup).

* Look into coronary artery calcium (CAC) / CT angiogram to be done at
  some point in the next 2-3 years. This seems to need a doctor's
  referral (per quick Googling) unlike the stuff in the preceding
  point.

* Cologuard (FIT and FOBT) colon cancer screening

* Whole body MRI

* Gum tissue graft -- get a deeper understanding of what the process
  involves and decide whether and when to do a specialist consultation
  and what questions to cover in the consultation.

## Best practices documents to write or expand

My plan for making progress on these is that, in weeks where I am
relative low on other one-off tasks in the health space, I'll pick one
doc from this list and spend 1-2 hours on it, likely on a Wednesday or
Friday

* [Stress and depression](../best-practices/best-practices-around-stress-and-depression.md)

* Urination and fluid intake

* Eye irritation

* Dental pain (both spontaneous and after procedures)

* Cold and flu

* Eye exam (preparatory steps); these will likely get bundled with
  whenever I get ready to book the eye exam

* Falling asleep, relaxing under adverse conditions, non-sleep deep
  rest (this is different from [best practices around
  sleep](../best-practices/best-practices-around-sleep.md) that are
  focused more on the timing of going to bed and waking up, rather
  than the psychology of actually falling asleep.

## Documents to write and augment with my improved understanding

* Weaning myself away from using laptop in bed (March 2020 to late 2022)
