# Things to investigate

List last updated: 2025-02-26

Time on these things would be in a mix of personal chores and other
activities buckets. The other activities bucket would be used for
general learning, including watching YouTube videos. The personal
chores bucket would be for focused work for my own health, including
best practices documentation, event logging, purchasing supplements
and tests, going to get the tests, documenting the results, etc.

The work can further be classified as time-sensitive (triggered by
currently occurring issues) versus non-time-sensitive (most other
exploratory stuff). The (personal chores bucket, non-time-sensitive)
stuff I generally try to do on weekdays only. The other buckets I can
do on weekdays or weekends. The other activities bucket stuff is
limited to 2 hours per day as it falls under POCS; see [best practices
around exertion and
stimulation](../best-practices/best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation.md).

My goal is to be sufficiently forward-thinking with this list that I
investigate and consolidate knowledge before it becomes
time-sensitive.

## Investigations into health conditions

* Investigate lipid-lowering strategies (focused on LDL and Apo
  B). Notes [here](lipid-lowering-strategies.md).

## Supplements

* Creatine supplement (deferred for now as I want to focus on the most
  important amino acids first).

## Other treatments

* Topical minoxidil for balding; both the how-to (for instance, the
  videos
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+use+minoxidil))
  and more on the theory of how balding and hair regrowth work; also,
  learn more about more powerful and risky tools like finasteride

## Tests

* Execute on [2025 blood test plans: round
  2](../events/2025/2025-blood-test-plans-round-2.md).

* Finish data entry for blood tests done 2025-01-22.

  * Look into 23andMe MTHFR stuff and methylated B vitamin
    investigation in connection with homocysteine analysis.

* Look into DEXA scans to be done in 2025. For instance, whole-body
  scans by BodySpec (see
  [here](https://www.bodyspec.com/blog/post/dexa_faq)) or do I want a
  more specialized one? I likely only need one every 5 years or so if
  it comes out okay.

  Likely action: May/June 2025; continued research and work on myself
  until then

  Progress so far:

  * I wrote [best practices around DEXA
    scans](../best-practices/best-practices-around-dexa-scans.md).

  * I've watched a few videos and have some further material to watch.

  * I plan to get the DEXA around May/June 2025 (as I want to focus my
    energy on other things right now). I also plan to continue
    focusing on exercises and other practices that are expected to
    improve the underlying data for the time being. The reason for not
    getting the DEXA sooner is that I don't expect the DEXA to be
    decision-relevant for the near term -- for a wide range of
    plausible outcomes, I expect the same action items in the near
    term. The DEXA is more useful as a long-term benchmark, and it
    would be more interesting to get this benchmark after more time
    following the kind of exercise regimen that I think is both
    desirable and sustainable.

* Get a heart echocardiogram, ECG. etc. For instance,
  https://www.lifelinescreening.com/lp/vascular-screening-nurse offers
  a package for $159 including carotid artery, abdominal aortic
  aneurysm, EKG for atrial fibrillation, and peripheral arterial
  disease.

* Look into coronary artery calcium (CAC) / CT angiogram to be done at
  some point in the next 2-3 years. This seems to need a doctor's
  referral (per quick Googling) unlike the stuff in the preceding
  point.

## Procedures

* Gum tissue graft -- get a deeper understanding of what the process
  involves and decide whether and when to do a specialist consultation
  and what questions to cover in the consultation.

## Best practices docs to write or expand

My plan for making progress on these is that, in weeks where I am
relative low on other one-off tasks in the health space, I'll pick one
doc from this list and spend 1-2 hours on it, likely on a Wednesday or
Friday

* [Stress and depression](../best-practices/best-practices-around-stress-and-depression.md)

* Urination and fluid intake

* Eye irritation

* Dental pain (both spontaneous and after procedures)

* Cold and flu

* Eye exam (preparatory steps)

* Falling asleep, relaxing under adverse conditions, non-sleep deep
  rest (this is different from [best practices around
  sleep](../best-practices/best-practices-around-sleep.md) that are
  focused more on the timing of going to bed and waking up, rather
  than the psychology of actually falling asleep.

## Documents to write and augment with my improved understanding

* Weaning myself away from using laptop in bed (March 2020 to late 2022)
