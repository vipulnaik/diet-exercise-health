# 2026-02-02: unplanned unnoticed fast

I finished my second meal on 2026-02-01 at 9:29 PM.

I ended up getting engrossed in some complex work later that evening,
and then again the next afternoon, and for that and various logistical
reasons, I started my next meal on 2026-02-02 at 6:07 PM. The gap was
about 20 hour 38 minutes, more than the 19 hours that should trigger
the [best
practices](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-fasting.md).

However, I didn't really think about it when starting my meal, so
other than drinking water throughout (which I did for other reasons) I
didn't follow the best practices. In particular, I still had
sauerkraut and walnuts as usual.

I did notice a bit of throat soreness after the meal, and the fast was
a likely contributor.
