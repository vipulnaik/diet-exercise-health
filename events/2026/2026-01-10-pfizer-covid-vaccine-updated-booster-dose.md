## Appointment booking

I booked my appointment for the COVID vaccine (indicating a preference
for Pfizer) on Sunday January 4. The appointment is for Saturday
January 10 at 3:30 PM at the 2801 Adeline Street location.

I followed the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
for the process. Since the appointment was for a Saturday, I did not
have to worry about conflicts with the day job.

### Initial booking with review of CDC guidance

The first time I booked was at around 3 PM. I did the booking and
filled the consent form. As part of the booking process, I read
through these five pages on the CDC website that were linked directly
or indirectly by Walgreens. These were to confirm my vaccine
eligibility.

* [People with Certain Medical Conditions and COVID-19 Risk Factors |
  Covid | CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html)

* [COVID-19 Vaccines | COVID-19 |
  CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/index.html)

* [Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States | Covid | CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Fclinical-considerations%2Finterim-considerations-us.html)

* [Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the
  United
  States](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/downloads/hcp/interim-clinical-considerations.pdf)
  (PDF with the most detailed version of the eligibility guidance)

The CDC guidance confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccine was still
allowed/recommended for me. The section that applied to me was "1d:
Ages 12–64 years" on Page 12 with the subcase "Previously vaccinated
before 2025–2026 vaccine" and the recommendation was "Administer 1
dose of 2025–2026 vaccine". For Pfizer, the recommendation was "At
least 8 weeks after last dose".

### Login gotcha

It turned out I was not logged in fully (Walgreens did show a "Hi,
Vipul" based on cookies when I was booking, which made me think I am
logged in. But it wasn't considered being logged in as far as the
vaccination-booking process is concerned, and nowhere during the
vaccination flow did it prod me to log in, so I did not realize at the
time.

I only noticed later in the vening when I logged in to my account and
could not find the appointment in the list. I re-booked at around 6:20
PM. This time, when booking, I was offered the option of booking using
my account versus as a guest, an option that I had not been given last
time.

To re-book at the same time, I needed to free up the vaccine slot from
my original booking, so I opened an incognito window where I was able
to access the appointment using the confirmation number, then canceled
it there. That freed up the slot and I was able to re-book the slot.

I confirmed after this second booking that the appointment showed up
in the list of appointments accessible to me when logged in. I also
received the appointment email with the new confirmation number.

### Required forms

After booking the vaccine, I filled the consent form. The questions
were as follows:

* Do you have a history of allergic reactions or allergies to latex,
  medications, food, or vaccines (e.g., polyethylene glycol,
  polysorbate, eggs, bovine protein, gelatin, gentamicin, polymyxin,
  neomycin, phenol, yeast, or thimerosal)?

  Answer: No

* Have you ever had a reaction after receiving a vaccination,
  including fainting or feeling dizzy?

  Answer: No

* Have you ever had a seizure disorder for which you are on seizure
  medication(s), a brain disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome (a
  condition that causes paralysis) or other nervous system problem?

  Answer: No

* Check any vaccinations you've received in the past. Include a best
  estimate for the month(MM) and year(YYYY) of each vaccination.

  * COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2): 03/2025
    ([details](../2025/2025-03-21-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md))

  * Herpes zoster (shingles): did not check

  * Influenza (flu): 11/2025 ([details](../2025/2025-11-08-flu-shot.md))

  * Pneumococcal (pneumonia): did not check

  * Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): did not check

  * Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap): 07/2024
    ([details](../2024/2024-07-12-tdap-vaccine-booster-dose.md))

* Have you received any vaccinations or skin tests in the past eight weeks?

  Answer: No

* Do you have any chronic health condition(s), such as cancer, chronic
  kidney disease, immunocompromised, chronic lung disease, obesity,
  sickle cell disease, diabetes, heart disease?

  Answer: No

After getting through the questions, I read the vaccine information
statement, scrolled through and clicked Accept on the consent, and got
through the signature page that was mostly pre-filled with details
from my account.

At the end, I got back to the appointment page with this banner on top:

> Consent forms completed. We look forward to seeing you soon!

#### Required forms gotcha

Even after I fill in the consent form, if I re-open the appointment to
manage it, it prompts me again to "Complete required forms". I did
this a second time and it still prompted me. There is no way to review
past filled answers.

## Preparation

### Calendar reminders and other upfront preparation

Following the best practices, I did the following; the end result was
a total of 12 calendar reminders on my personal calendar (1 shared
with work calendar) and 1 maintenance window:

* Vaccine appointment calendar reminder from 1 PM to 6 PM, starting
  2.5 hours prior and ending 2.5 hours after the appointment time. I
  also invited my work email address, though it's not that important
  since it's on a Saturday.

* Maintenance windows for work alerts for Saturday 2026-01-10 from
  9:30 AM to 8 PM ("start five hours prior to the appointment and end
  four hours after the end").

* Overrides for me: I'm not on any shared on-calls at the time, so
  nothing to do here!

* Work calendar events and Slack reminders: Nothing to do here!

* Shopping reminder for 2 days prior: I added a calendar reminder for
  Thursday 2026-01-08.

* Weather check reminder for 2 days prior: I added a calendar reminder
  for Thursday 2026-01-08.

* Pause and resume reminders for strength exercises and hand gripper
  exercises: I added the following calendar reminders:

  * Pause reminder on Thursday 2026-01-08 (2 days prior)

  * Resume reminder for hand gripper exercises with the left hand on
    Wednesday 2026-01-14 (4 days after)

  * Resume reminder for hand griper exercises with the right hand on
    Saturday 2026-01-17 (7 days after)

  * Resume reminder for strength exercises on Monday 2026-01-19 (9 days after)

* Reminder to update internal records 1 day after: I added a calendar
  reminder for Sunday 2026-01-11.

* Reminder to check and update copies of digital records 4 days after:
  I added a calendar reminder for Wednesday 2026-01-14.

* Reminder to pause jogging and breath holds on the morning of: I
  added a calendar reminder for the morning of Saturday 2026-01-10.

* Reminder to resume jogging and breath holds 3 days after: I added a
  calendar reminder for Tuesday 2026-01-13.

* Packing / prep reminder for the night prior: I added a calendar
  reminder for the night of Friday 2026-01-09.

### 2026-01-08: started pause of hand gripper exercises and strength exercises

On Thursday 2026-01-08, I started the planned pause of hand gripper
exercises and strength exercises for the upcoming COVID vaccine
appointment on Saturday 2026-01-10. I still did jogging as usual.

### 2026-01-08 evening: completed weather check

On the evening of 2026-01-08, I completed the weather check, as
planned, for the time of the vaccine. I confirmed that rain was not
expected at the time, and the weather was not too bad (it was colder
than ideal, but okay).

### 2026-01-09 evening: shopping at Trader Joe's

My original intention (as codified in the calendar reminder) was to go
shopping at Trader Joe's on 2026-01-08, two days prior to the vaccine
appointment. However, for scheduling reasons, I was not able to make
that trip. I ended up going on the evening of Friday
2026-01-09. Unfortunately, some items were not in stock which means I
am very likely to need to make a trip on either Sunday or Monday (one
or two days after the vaccine), which is not ideal but it's okay.

### 2026-01-10: packing/prep for appointment

My original intention (as codified in the calendar reminder) had been
do packing/prep for the vaccine appointment the previous night, but I
didn't get time so I did it at around noon on the day of the
appointment.

### 2026-01-10: started pause of jogging and breath holds

On Saturday 2026-01-10, I started the pause of jogging and breath
holds as planned. I had also skipped jogging the previous day
(2026-01-09) for scheduling reasons, but I had done breath holds on
that day.

## Appointment

### Arrival and check-in

I arrived at the Walgreens location near the check-in counter at
around 3:12 PM. They didn't have the machine to scan, so I used the
link they had sent me via SMS to check in. I only had to answer one
question confirming that I have not felt sick in the past 24 hours.

I was then called up to confirm some details, then asked to wait
outside the vaccination room.

### Vaccination process

Around 3:25 PM I was called into the vaccination room. I received the
COVID vaccine in my right arm. I confirmed that I was receiving the
Pfizer COVID vaccine dose. The medication name was Comirnaty and the
dose was 0.3ml.

I had received the dose by around 3:28 PM. I got my COVID vaccine
record card updated. The pharmacist said that the digital immunization
record is now the one in use and the paper vaccine record card does
not need to be updated. I exited the room at around 3:30 PM along with
my COVID vaccine record card and the information leaflet including
details of the vaccine that I had received.

### Post-appointment shopping

After the vaccine, I stayed on at Walgreens for about ten minutes, and
I used the time to do some shopping. I completed the purchase at 3:40
PM and exited the store a minute or two later. I then headed back
home.

## Aftereffects

### Soreness at injection site

The soreness developed over a few hours after the vaccine, and then
stabilized for the rest of the day. The following notes from [last
time's COVID
vaccine](../2025/2025-03-21-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md)
fit my experience this time as well:

> As expected, the soreness was maximal over the bandage (so right
> around where the injection happened) but also it wasn't symmetrical
> around it -- it was more as I moved up my arm than as I moved down
> my arm. In fact, there was almost no soreness even on touch right
> below the bandage, but there was clearly some above the bandage.

> The soreness was not distracting, so unless I touched the area or
> directed my thoughts to it, it didn't get in my way.

### Tightness in the back of the neck

Late at night (past 10 PM) I noticed some tightness in the back of the
neck, but it was pretty mild. I would not even have noted it down, but
for the fact that I had noted it down last time and I want to note it
down this time for parity.`

### Sleep challenges

This was mostly a result of the soreness at injection site, but I want
to describe it a little more because it highlights an interaction with
weather that could inform the timing of the vaccine in the future.

Last time, although I had trouble sleeping on my right side, I was
able to adjust my sleeping posture to not put weight directly on my
right shoulder. However, there was an additional challenge this time:
temperature.

Last time, the indoor temperature had been 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20
degrees Celsius) around the time I went to sleep, and dropped to
around 61 degrees Fahrenheit in the morning.

This time, the indoor temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15
degrees Celsius) around the time I went to sleep, and 58 degrees
Fahrenheit when I woke up (pretty late) and it likely dropped to
around 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius) at its lowest point
at night.

At this lower temperature, it's harder to have a sleep posture
sleeping on the right side where my right arm is not directly under
the weight of my body. So the posture changes I was able to do last
time didn't work as well.

I spent the majority of my time sleeping on my left side (this is what
I did at the time of going to sleep) but sleeping on one side for the
whole night is hard, and the brief periods at night when I had to
switch to sleeping on my right side were unpleasant.

This is an argument for trying to get the vaccine around the
October/November period or the March/April period rather than in
January when it's generally coldest, though in the grand scheme of
things this is a minor consideration. In this case, I picked January
both due to scheduling considerations and because the previous dose
was in March, and I like to have a gap of at least 9 months between
doses.
