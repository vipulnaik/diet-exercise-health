## 2026-01-01: skipped strength exercises due to time constraints

On Thursday 2026-01-01, I did hand gripper exercises as well as
at-home jogging but skipped strength exercises. I had been planning to
do them, but a cleaning task (removing hair and dirt from the caster
wheels of my office chair) ended up taking longer than anticipated,
and I didn't want to delay my first meal time considering that I
planned to do another round of meal prep for my second meal.

## 2026-01-02: skipped all exercises to make early afternoon trip

On Friday 2026-01-02, I woke up late at noon. I needed to make a trip
to Trader Joe's for food purchases before rain resumed later in the
afternoon/evening. Due to time constraints and also to conserve
energy, I skipped all exercises (if I had woken up earlier, I would
likely have at done hand gripper exercises but skipped jogging and
strength exercises).

## 2026-01-05: abridged at-home jogging and skipping of some exercises

On Monday 2026-01-05, due to time constraints (partly driven by a work
meeting) I did abridged at-home jogging; I jogged for about 26 minutes
instead of the usual of at least 30 minutes. I also skipped hand
gripper exercises (I originally skipped in the morning with the
intention of doing them later in the day, but then never got around to
them) as well as the humming-with-intermittent-pauses exercise that
was due. I didn't have strength exercises due on this day.
