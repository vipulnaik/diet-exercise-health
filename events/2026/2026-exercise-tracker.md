## 2026-01-01: skipped strength exercises due to time constraints

On Thursday 2026-01-01, I did hand gripper exercises as well as
at-home jogging but skipped strength exercises. I had been planning to
do them, but a cleaning task (removing hair and dirt from the caster
wheels of my office chair) ended up taking longer than anticipated,
and I didn't want to delay my first meal time considering that I
planned to do another round of meal prep for my second meal.

## 2026-01-02: skipped all exercises to make early afternoon trip

On Friday 2026-01-02, I woke up late at noon. I needed to make a trip
to Trader Joe's for food purchases before rain resumed later in the
afternoon/evening. Due to time constraints and also to conserve
energy, I skipped all exercises (if I had woken up earlier, I would
likely have at done hand gripper exercises but skipped jogging and
strength exercises).

## 2026-01-05: abridged at-home jogging and skipping of some exercises

On Monday 2026-01-05, due to time constraints (partly driven by a work
meeting) I did abridged at-home jogging; I jogged for about 26 minutes
instead of the usual of at least 30 minutes. I also skipped hand
gripper exercises (I originally skipped in the morning with the
intention of doing them later in the day, but then never got around to
them) as well as the humming-with-intermittent-pauses exercise that
was due. I didn't have strength exercises due on this day.

## 2026-01-08: started pause of hand gripper exercises and strength exercises

On Thursday 2026-01-08, I started the planned pause of hand gripper
exercises and strength exercises for the [upcoming COVID vaccine
appointment on Saturday
2026-01-10](2026-01-10-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md). I
still did jogging as usual.

## 2026-01-09: skipped jogging

On Friday 2026-01-09, I skipped jogging, primarily to make sure I have
my first meal early enough and sleep early enough so that my schedule
is not too disrupted for my [COVID vaccine appointment the next
day](2026-01-10-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md). Strength
exercises and hand gripper exercises were already paused. I did breath
holds as usual.

## 2026-01-10: started pause of jogging and breath holds for COVID vaccine

On Saturday 2026-01-10, I started the pause of jogging and breath
holds as planned. This was for my [COVID vaccine appointment on
2026-01-10](2026-01-10-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md). I
had also skipped jogging the previous day (2026-01-09) for scheduling
reasons, but I had done breath holds on that day.

## 2026-01-14: resumed hand gripper exercises with left hand as well as jogging

Both these resumptions were after pauses related to the [2026-01-10
COVID vaccine booster
dose](2026-01-10-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md).

### Hand gripper exercises with left hand

I resumed hand gripper exercises with my left hand (I got the vaccine
in my right arm) on Wednesday 2026-01-14, four days after the vaccine,
as planned.

I was able to do 15 seconds with the 150 lb hand gripper and 22
seconds with the 100 lb hand gripper. This is lower than my usual, but
not by a huge amount. It likely reflects some slight deconditioning
and still being on the recovery trajectory from the insult of the
vaccine.

### Jogging

I resumed jogging on Wednesday 2026-01-14 (four days after the
vaccine), a day after the planned date of 2026-01-13 (three days after
the vaccine). The delay was primarily for scheduling / logistics
reasons.

It took me a few days to recover to my normal level of jogging. See
[2026-01-10 COVID vaccine booster dose (jogging
subsection)](2026-01-10-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md#jogging)
for more information.

## 2026-01-17: resumed hand gripper exercises with right hand

I resumed hand gripper exercises with my right hand I got the vaccine
in my right arm) on Saturday 2026-01-17, seven days after the vaccine,
as planned.

Performance was around the middle of the normal range starting the day
I resumed.

## 2026-01-19: resumed strength exercises

I resumed strength exercises on Monday 2026-01-19, nine days after the
vaccine, as planned. Performance was within the normal range.

## 2026-01-21: skipped all exercises to make time for administrative work

On Wednesday 2026-01-21, I skipped all exercises so that I could do an
administrative task (physical sorting of documents) in the morning and
early afternoon period before my first meal.

## 2026-01-23: skipped all exercises due to scheduling constraints

On Friday 2026-01-23, I skipped all exercises because of a combination
of these factors:

* I got delayed in the morning and early afternoon due to
  time-sensitive stuff with the day job.

* I had a packed schedule of stuff to do later in the day, so I could
  not afford to delay my meal too much.

## 2026-01-25: skipped jogging due to delays

On Sunday 2026-01-25, I skipped jogging as I had gotten pretty delayed
as a result of several small tasks. I did do hand gripper exercises
and humming-with-intermittent-pauses; strength exercises were not due
on this day. I didn't do jogging because the combined delay of jogging
plus the post-jogging cooldown time would have delayed my first meal
too much.

## 2026-01-26: skipped all exercises

On Monday 2026-01-26, I skipped all exercises in order to make an
administrative trip in the afternoon.

## 2026-01-30: skipped all exercises

On Friday 2026-01-30, I skipped all exercises. This was because I got
delayed in the morning as a result of some time-sensitive stuff at
work, and I didn't want to delay things too much as I wanted to make a
downtown Berkeley trip that included places that were closing at 5 PM.

## 2026-02-01: skipped jogging and strength exercises

On Sunday 2026-02-01, I skipped jogging and strength exercises. The
motivation was that I didn't want to delay my meal too much (so that I
could do meal prep and other stuff later in the day), and I also
needed to make a trip to Berkeley Bowl in the slot that I would
usually use for jogging.

I did do hand gripper exercises and breath holds.
