## 2026-01-01: skipped strength exercises due to time constraints

On Thursday 2026-01-01, I did hand gripper exercises as well as
at-home jogging but skipped strength exercises. I had been planning to
do them, but a cleaning task (removing hair and dirt from the caster
wheels of my office chair) ended up taking longer than anticipated,
and I didn't want to delay my first meal time considering that I
planned to do another round of meal prep for my second meal.
