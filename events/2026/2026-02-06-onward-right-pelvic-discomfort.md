## Executive summary

### Symptoms and clinical observations

Starting Friday 2026-02-06 (symptoms noticed overnight starting
2026-02-07) I experienced a range of symptoms and had corresponding
clinical observations:

* Discomfort in the right pelvic and lower abdominal region (palpable
  soreness in some areas, similar to that experienced at a vaccine
  administration site) (primary symptom) (experienced continuously
  for the next few days)

* Tightness of shorts, suggesting slight distension (not visible)
  (initial symptom) (intermittent, generally experienced at night when
  wearing shorts after night-time bath)

* Intermittent abdominal discomfort and increased flatulence
  (experienced mostly on 2026-02-07)

* Increased methane fermentation levels as measured on 2026-02-09 and
  2026-02-10

* Increased sleep need

### Current hypothesis

My current hypothesis is methanogen increase and release from the
appendix, causing the downstream symptoms and clinical observations.

## Background

### Hectic week at work (2026-02-02 to 2026-02-06)

I had a hectic week at work from Monday 2026-02-02 to
2026-02-06. There was no particular foreseeable source of this; it
just so happened that there were time-sensitive things to work on in
the morning and early afternoon on every one of the five days of the
week. Normally, this happens somewhere between 0 and 2 weekdays in the
week, and it's very unusual for it to happen for more than 3 weekdays,
but this time, it happened on all 5.

It wasn't just the total time, but the time-sensitive nature of the
work and its timing early in the day, that had implications for other
stuff discussed below.

### Skipping of most exercises (2026-02-01 to 2026-02-06)

I skipped jogging and strength exercises on Sunday 2026-02-01 to
schedule a trip to Berkeley Bowl. At the time, I wasn't aware that I
would end up skipping jogging and strength exercises for the next five
days.

From Monday 2026-02-02 to Friday 2026-02-06, I skipped jogging and
strength exercises on all five days, thanks to the time-sensitive
stuff at work.

Therefore, I had effectively not done jogging and strength exercises
for 6 consecutive days as of 2026-02-06.

I did do hand gripper exercises on three of the six days (2026-02-01,
2026-02-04, 2026-02-06). I did breath holds on 2026-02-01 and
humming-with-intermittent-pauses on 2026-02-04, which matches my usual
frequency of doing those exercises.

Overall, I was significantly exercise-deprived compared to usual,
where I generally don't skip jogging for 3 or more consecutive days.

### Backlog of cyclic personal chores with long time block commitments

I have a list of cyclic personal chores with long time block
commitments, including meal prep, laundry, and getting groceries from
Trader Joe's. I generally aim to do at least 1 cyclic personal chore
with long time block commitments. Skipping on one day due to having
too much stuff to do is generally okay if I can do 2 cyclic personal
chores with long time block commitments on a subsequent day.

The disruption created by time-sensitive stuff at work led me to skip
cyclic personal chores with long time block commitments on 2 weekdays
(2026-02-02 and 2026-02-05), while still being able to do only 1 per
day on the remaining weekdays. This meant that, getting into
2026-02-06, I was backlogged on cyclic personal chores with long time
block commitments.

### Delayed and somewhat-reduced sleep

While my total amount of sleep was only slightly below normal, I went
to sleep somewhat late every day, even compared to what I had been
doing the preceding week. This was also due to the time-sensitive
stuff at work every morning / early afternoon, that made it hard to
have the deliberately shorter day needed to set my sleep cycle to
earlier.

## Likely trigger: Udupi Palace spinach masala dosa consumption

On Friday 2026-02-06, I decided to get Udupi Palace spinach masala
dosa takeout along with my Trader Joe's trip. There were a few
reasons:

* It was due; I try to get spinach masala dosa every 1 to 3 months,
  and I had last gotten it on 2025-12-14.

* As I was somewhat behind on cyclic personal chores, I felt that
  getting the Udupi Palace spinach masala dosa would help me a little
  bit by reducing consumption of my own cooked food and giving me a
  bit more room to catch up on my cyclic personal chores backlog.

* I was also somewhat mildly craving variety (this was not a big
  factor on its own, and the two factors above were more important).

The consumption itself went fine; I didn't notice any issues in the
immediate aftermath.

## Development of symptoms

### Tightness of shorts on 2026-02-07 (overnight from 2026-02-06)

After washing up on 2026-02-07, overnight from 2026-02-06, when
putting on my shorts, I noticed that the shorts felt tight. This was
weird to me. I initially wondered if I've just grown fatter. I was
able to identify that the tightness was more salient around the right
pelvic area, and I was able to feel it at the level of the skin by
pinching it.

In any case, the tightness became less salient after a few minutes
and I went to sleep.

### Stabilization of symptoms on 2026-02-07
 
After waking up on Saturday 2026-02-07, I noticed intermittent
abdominal discomfort and increased flatulence, including some
foul-smelling flatulence a few times (later in the evening / at night).

The right pelvic soreness was now a more pronounced but still dull
soreness (so unpleasant and always present if probed, but not
something that significantly distracted me from other work I was
doing).

I also sneezed more often than usual on this day, though it's not
clear if that's related.

I also resumed exercise on 2026-02-07. I went out jogging, and jogged
within my usual range (albeit at the low end). The right pelvic
soreness was not distracting enough to get in the way.

### Long overnight sleep from 2026-02-07 to 2026-02-08, plus continued sleep cycle pullback

Due to the backlog of cyclic personal chores with long time block
commitments, I needed to squeeze in two of these on Saturday
2026-02-07, which meant that I still wasn't able to go to sleep early;
I ended up going to sleep at around a similar time as the past few
days.

I ended up sleeping for almost 10 hours, which might reflect some
sleep backlog but also potentially increased sleep needs due to the
health issues causing the right pelvic discomfort.

On Sunday 2026-02-08, I decided to take the productivity hit by having
a short day (13.5 waking hours) and therefore going to sleep about
half an hour before the previous day despite sleeping for 10 hours
overnight. I was able to keep a short day on Monday as well and go to
sleep about 1.5 hours earlier on Monday. Based on these, I was also
able to pull back my waking time gradually to a more sustainable
level, despite sleeping longer than usual on most days. NOTE: The
earlier-than-usual waking time on 2026-02-11 (going from 2026-02-10)
was because I wanted to be up by that time for some stuff.

For more, see the [sleep and waking times](#sleep-and-waking-times) table.

### Bowel movement patterns

My bowel movement patterns stayed mostly normal, with a single bowel
movement shortly after waking up that cleared my bowels, with no
experienced constipation or tenesmus. However, a few notes:

* The relatively spicy nature of the Udupi Palace takeout could be
  felt somewhat for the next couple of days (no major issues, but
  still noticeable).

* I experienced a clearly-larger-than-usual volume of bowel movement
  on 2026-02-08, after the longer sleep. This, along with the
  flatulence experienced on 2026-02-07, suggests that there was some
  degree of incomplete evacuation on 2026-02-07 related to the Udupi
  Palace spinach masala dosa consumption on 2026-02-06.

* In the coming days, I did feel a little more hesitancy when
  completing bowel movements than usual, but still completed bowel
  movements satisfactorily.

## Deeper dive into right pelvic discomfort

### Surface examination

Unlike past cases of abdominal discomfort where the discomfort was
visceral and not directly triggered by touch, the pelvic discomfort in
this case was more similar to soreness that I experience at a vaccine
administration site after the vaccine. Specifically, it can be
experienced and heightened by touching the area.

This meant that I could draw the contours of the sore area fairly
clearly. This area is the upper end of the right front bone of the
pelvis (I believe this is called the right anterior superior iliac
spine according to online sources), a couple of inches above it,and a
couple of inches to the left and rolling around to the back.

The sore area looked ever-so-slightly more swollen and maybe a tad
redder than the surrounding area and the equivalent area on the left
side, but honestly the differences are really small and I might be
imagining them.

The soreness is accentuated even more by pinching than by touching.

My current guess is that there was some inflammation affecting the
skin and subcutaneous layer in the area, which is likely related to
some of the appendix stuff mentioned further down.

### Negative results for additional palpation pain, muscle guarding, and rebound tenderness

I was able to palpate all the sore areas (and other nearby areas). I
did not notice significant additional pain on palpation, muscle
guarding, or rebound tenderness. This led me to downgrade the
probability of an acute issue.

### Relation between discomfort and sleep

On some of the nights, I experienced discomfort that affected my sleep
quality.

On the night going from 2026-02-10 to 2026-02-11, I noticed something
interesting at night when I briefly got into a semi-waking state. In
the sleepy state, I didn't feel any soreness in the right pelvic area,
even when I probed it with my thoughts. This made me very pleased. But
as my degree of wakefulness increased, the discomfort returned. This
suggests there is some process by which that sensation gets
disconnected as I fall asleep, but it comes back at some level of
wakefulness.

### Use of healing cream over the affected skin

Given the fact that some of the soreness was accessible at the surface
level, I decided on 2026-02-11 to try using a healing cream. Instead
of the vaseline soothing hydration that I generally use for my hands
and legs, I used the Jergens Ultra Healing cream which leaves less
residue and seems better designed for healing. I applied it to both
the sore area and an equivalent area on the left side.

The sore area had more of a slight burning sensation than the
equivalent area on the left side.

## Appendix and methanogen hypothesis-chasing

### Relation between area of soreness and appendix

The appendix is behind [McBurney's
point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McBurney%27s_point), which is 1/3
of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the
navel. McBurney's point reflects approximately the start of the
wrapped area where the soreness happens, so I suspect the issue has
something to do with the appendix. However, the negative results for
additional palpation pain, muscle guarding, and rebound tenderness
suggest to me that it's not acute appendicitis.

### The methane hypothesis

After my [2024-07-18 onward abdominal
discomfort](../2024/2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md),
I had narrowed in on intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) as a
likely cause. I had gotten some evidence in favor of this based on
FoodMarble Aire 2 readings of somewhat elevated methane during the
abdominal discomfort period, but these were taken toward the tail-end
of the issues, so I didn't have a clear picture.

In FoodMarble Aire 2 readings over the past several months, I have
measured methane levels of zero.

The relationship between the appendix and methanogens is that the
appendix is believed to serve as a reservoir for methanogens, so even
while methane fermentation levels are zero, I might have dormant
methanogens in the appendix, and something could trigger these
methanogens to get released. So my theory was something like this:

* The Udupi Palace spinach masala dosa consumption, in light of the
  background of a hectic week with skipped exercise and reduced/delayed
  sleep, somehow caused the methanogens to grow in number.

* This may have caused some distension of the appendix, or other
  inflammation, that caused slight inflammation of the surrounding
  skin and fat, which is what is driving the soreness.

* Some of the methanogens may also have been released into the GI
  system, causing the release of methane into the GI tract and
  therefore some constipation-like GI issues.

I got FoodMarble Aire 2 readings on 2026-02-09 and 2026-02-10, getting
scores of 1.7 and 1.6 respectively, which correspond to methane levels
of 8.5 ppm and 8.0 ppm respectively. These are much higher than the
levels since September 2024 during my previous abdominal discomfort,
though lower than the cutoff for a definite diagnosis of IMO. See
[foodmarble_aire_2_breath_tests.sql](../../sql/foodmarble_aire_2_breath_tests.sql)
for more breath test result details.

### Atrantil

I had a bunch of Atrantil left over from attempted use after the 2024
abdominal discomfort. On 2026-02-10, with my first meal, I took 2
Atrantil capsules. I did experience burps suggesting that the Atrantil
reached my stomach, but my guess is that the dose so far is too little
to make it clear if the Atrantil is working.

## Data appendix

NOTE: The word "appendix" here is not referring to appendix as a body
organ, but appendix as a document section.
