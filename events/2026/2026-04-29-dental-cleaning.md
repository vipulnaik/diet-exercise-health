# 2026-04-29: dental cleaning

I have a dental cleaning appointment scheduled for Wednesday
2026-04-29 at 1 PM at Total Health Dental Care at 3017 Telegraph
Avenue for a regular dental cleaning at 1 PM. The previous dental
cleaning had been on [2025-10-22](../2025/2025-10-22-dental-cleaning.md).

## Prior preparation

### Appointment set on 2025-10-22 after check-in for that dental cleaning

My appointment was set automatically, and I received an email about
it, shortly after checking in for my dental cleaning on
[2025-10-22](../2025/2025-10-22-dental-cleaning.md), even before the
actual dental cleaning happened. The appointment time was likely
chosen based on the 27 weeks gap that seems to be the default they
adhere to.

### Creation of calendar event, reminders etc. on 2025-11-09

On Sunday 2025-11-09, I created the calendar event, on-call
maintenance windows and overrides, and calendar reminders, following
the [best practices around dental cleaning
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-dental-cleaning-appointments.md). The
delay was because I wanted to first complete processing and
documenting information from the dental cleaning, some of which I
expected would influence my best practices and therefore the details
of the calendar events.

Here are the steps I took:

* I created a calendar reminder for 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM on the day of
  the dental cleaning.

* I set a maintenance window for most alert services where I am
  primary for the period starting 9 PM the previous night (2026-04-28)
  and going to 6 PM.

* The appointment time had been chosen at a time when I am not on-call
  in rotations, so no on-call override coordination was needed.

* I set a calendar reminder for 2 weeks before the dental cleaning to
  make sure my work calendar is clear.

* I set a calendar reminder for 2 weeks before the dental cleaning to
  start and consider food pauses.

* I set a calendar reminder for 1 week before the dental cleaning to
  execute the dental self-exam checklist.

* I set a calendar reminder for the Friday prior to the dental
  cleaning to consider cancellation, in light of the 72-hour policy.

* I set a calendar reminder for shopping 2 days prior to the dental
  cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to reduce fermentable food consumption
  starting 24 hours prior to the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder for normal face shaving the evening before
  the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder for packing / prep the night before the
  dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder for thorough face shaving the morning of
  the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to skip exercise the morning of the dental
  cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to skip sauerkraut and walnuts the morning
  of the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to decide regarding resumption of
  sauerkraut and walnuts after the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder for documentation for the evening of the
  dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to set reminders for the next appointment,
  for the evening of the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to check for head/neck/shoulder soreness
  the day after the dental cleaning.

* I set calendar reminders to talk less and drink more water one and
  two days after the dental cleaning.

* I set a calendar reminder to execute the dental self-exam checklist
  one week after the dental cleaning.
