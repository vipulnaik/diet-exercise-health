# 2025-11-27: health issues

Similar: [2025-10-02: health issues](2025-10-02-health-issues.md).

I experienced blood in stool and chills on Thursday 2025-11-27. Things
returned to mostly normal by the next day (2025-11-28). I suspect
specific actions in the past few days as causal.

## Events of the day

### Blood in stool and on wiping (around 9:42 AM)

I woke up at 9:20 AM and went for bowel movement at 9:42 AM. This was
a larger-than-usual bowel movement at about 125-150% of usual volume
(reasons described in the [Background](#background) section) but
otherwise felt normal to me while it was happening. However, after it
was done, I noticed blood in the stool and on wiping my anus,
particularly the lower part of the anus (so this is not related to the
tailbone area that can sometimes bleed slightly).

### Generally lower subjective temperature through the day, occasionally reaching the level of chills

The temperature had been dropping over the past few days, and it was
somewhat cold. But my sense of how cold it was was even more extreme,
i.e., my subjective sense of temperature was warped. There were times
when I reached the level of chills, with sudden spasms of
shivering. However, even otherwise, I felt a little colder than I
would normally have felt at that temperature.

The indoor temperature when I woke up was 58 degrees Fahrenheit. It
rose to 61 degrees Fahrenheit by around noon. It peaked at around 68
degrees Fahrenheit at around 3 PM, and dropped to around 60 degrees
Fahrenheit by midnight. Even at the peak of 68 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is normally a comfortably warm temperature for me with the
sweatshirt on, I felt a little cold.

### Feeling very cold as I tried to go to sleep

I went to sleep at 12:10 AM, having just finished my bath at 11:51 PM
(about 20 minutes ago). Normally, after having a bath, I am warmed up
so the heat protects me for a while against the ambient cold, by which
time I have fallen asleep. But this time, I had started feeling cold
by the time I went to sleep, even before I fell asleep. It took me a
long time to warm myself in bed, and the process was much more
unpleasant than usual.

## The next day

I woke up on Friday 2025-11-28 at 9:36 AM. Although it was colder at
this time (around 58 degrees Fahrenheit) than when I had gone to
sleep, I felt subjectively warmer, which suggests a return to normal
subjective temperature sensation. Although the day on the whole was
objectively a little colder than the previous day, I didn't feel
chills and was mostly able to navigate the cold as usual.

The only thing somewhat unusual about the day was that I did reduced
at-home jogging (25 minutes instead of the usual 30 to 35
minutes). The at-home piece was because of the lower temperature, and
the reduced amount was because I felt a bit tired. Interestingly, I
had done full outside jogging the previous day (before the chills had
become very obvious), but maybe that had been a bad idea.

## Background

The most likely cause of these events was something I did overnight
going from Tuesday 2025-11-25 to Wednesday 2025-11-26, plus followup
actions on Wednesday after waking up.

### Staying up late (overnight from 2025-11-25 to 2025-11-26)

I got into bed at 1:36 AM, a little later than usual, but still not
too far from the norm. My intention was to go to sleep in about 15 to
30 minutes after relaxing a bit in bed. However, while browsing on my
phone, I noticed an issue related to the day job. Given the upcoming
Thanksgiving break, I felt it's important to try to resolve the issue
before the break starts, and that it might be difficult to do so in
the limited time left. So, I stayed up until about 3:18 AM debugging
the issue. A large portion of this time was with my laptop in bed -- I
almost never use my laptop in bed these days, but in this case I
didn't feel like sitting outside without my legs covered.

It's not just that I stayed up late, but also:

* I didn't wear a sweatshirt so I was just in a regular half-sleeved
  T-shirt for that lengthy period while the indoor temperature was
  around 61 degrees Fahrenheit. I normally don't wear a sweatshirt
  between my bath and going to sleep, but generally it's a shorter
  period of under 30 minutes, and usually at a slightly warmer
  temperature. In this case, I was up for almost two hours at that
  temperature and without a sweatshirt, so my upper body was exposed
  to a lot more cold than usual.

* I was not psychologically prepared for staying up late, and this
  probably had physiological implications.

* The nature of the work triggered a sympathetic response where I got
  into an alert state, which probably wasn't good to have right before
  bed.

### Being on the computer after waking up (2025-11-26)

I woke up at around 9:50 AM. That's about 6.5 hours of sleep, which
isn't a lot, but isn't that low either. However, after waking up, I
continued debugging and collaborating on the issue for almost two
hours, until around 11:46 AM when I went for my bowel movement.

I normally go for bowel movement within less than an hour of waking up
and within less than 30 minutes of working on the computer; my work on
the computer before bowel movement is usually limited to executing my
morning checklist and maybe a couple of other small items. In this
case, though, I was on my computer for much longer, as I wanted to get
the problem resolved. I also didn't have a strong bowel movement urge,
but this was probably not coincidental either: my body had probably
signaled to hold off on bowel movement until the problem was solved.

Temperature played a role here too: since my normal amount of time
before bowel movement is small, I generally don't put on the
sweatshirt until after my bowel movement. (That also helps keep the
pressure to get the bowel movement done quickly, by making me feel a
bit uncomfortable). But in this case, being awake and using the
computer at an indoor temperature starting at 59 degrees Fahrenheit
(and gradually rising, but still low) without a sweatshirt meant my
upper body was exposed to a lot more cold than usual.

### Small bowel movement quantity (2025-11-26)

My bowel movement quantity was about 25% of usual. This is likely for
the reasons described above: shorter and delayed sleep, excess
sympathetic activation before sleep and after waking up, and cold
exposure. But since my food consumption the previous day had been
normal (and normal for the colder temperature, so on the high end of
normal) that meant that there was more stuff that hadn't come out, and
was backlogged for the next day.

### Rest of the day (2025-11-26)

While I did skip jogging on 2025-11-26, I did do hand gripper
exercises and breath holds and on the whole had a pretty normal and
productive day.

### How the background explains things

The insufficient bowel movement on 2025-11-26 likely explains the
larger-than-usual bowel movement on 2025-11-27, and may also be a
contributor to the blood -- the excess backlogged stool might have
caused issues.

In addition, the delayed sleep and cold exposure may have triggered a
slight immune and inflammatory response, that may have contributed to
the blood in stool and also to the chills.

## Learnings

First off, this incident highlights the cost of taking on a task late
at night, after I have started winding down for bed. However, there
may be situations where I deem such stuff as important enough to do,
so I should have better ways of coping with such tasks if I choose to
do them.

One important piece is the sweatshirt -- I should wear a sweatshirt if
I'm going beyond the 30-minute window that I am used to, and if the
temperature is such that I would wear it outside of the pre-sleep and
pre-bowel-movement circumstances. If I'm concerned about using a dirty
sweatshirt in bed against a clean pillowcase side, I can switch to a
new clean sweatshirt (this kind of incident should be rare enough that
the cost of extra laundry shouldn't really matter).

I should also continue efforts to streamline and speed up discovery of
issues so that I catch them during daytime hours where I can
investigate them without disrupting my sleep. Not all such incidents
are under my control, but I should at least try to streamline whatever
I can control.
