# 2025-11-11: right index finger impact against botom of kitchen shelves

## Incident

This was a very unusual and unexpected injury. I had placed a roll of
paper towels upright on a countertop on the kitchen. There were
shelves starting a few feet above the countertop. The paper towel was
not directly below the shelves, but under an open space, but the
shelves were close by.

I had a few other rolls of paper towels that were almost or entirely
complete, that I had not cleared out. These created a bit of clutter,
which might have been a contributor to what happened.

I reached out in a motion with my right hand toward the paper
towels. I think partly to avoid the other rolls of paper towels, my
right hand deviated a little bit upward and to the side, and it ended
up hitting the bottom of the shelves.

Normally, this sort of impact is a very minor one and doesn't even
hurt me. However, for whatever reason, my hand speed was higher than
usual today, and I also probably hit a rougher portion of the bottom
of the shelves than typical.

The impact was on the back of my right index finger, just distal of
the MCP joint. There appear to have been two points of impact.

I immediately felt a sharp surge of pain, gasping out even before I
could think. After a minute or two, there was bleeding from the
area. The bleeding wasn't stopping on its own quickly, so I applied a
water block tough strips bandage (rather than water block flex, in
light of this finger area having a larger circumference.

## Learnings

The incident feels very random. Normally, I don't hit things like
this; when I do, my speed is generally lower, and I don't hit a rough
patch that would cause so much bleeding.

Nonetheless, it does highlight the importance of being more consistent
with practices I generally try to follow (but slipped up on here)
while also highlighting a few other things I haven't thought about
that much.

Things I already try to do, that I slipped up on:

* Speed: I want to make sure my movements are slow so that even if
  there is an impact, it's not too bad.

* Margins: I want to aim to have good margins so that even if I
  miscalculate, I am still unlikely to actually hit anything.

* More thinking about unexpected impacts: I already record unexpected
  impacts, where some part of my body unexpectedly hits an object,
  even if it doesn't cause me any pain or injury, using `ui:` prefix
  in Slack self-chat logs. Reviewing these, I do see that impacts of
  the kind that happened today do occur 1 to 2 times a month, but
  usually with much lower speed and without hitting a rough edge, so
  they don't cause any pain or injury. Monitoring and trying to reduce
  the frequency of these over time should be an ongoing goal.

A few things I had not explicitly thought about, that are highlighted
by this incident:

* Route planning: This is somewhat related to the margins point, but a
  bit more specific. In the case of getting a paper towel, for
  instance, I should have chosen a route that didn't go that far high
  above the paper towels, but rather, started around the height of the
  paper towels.

* Clutter and adjustment: In this case, clutter on the countertop from
  paper towel rolls I hadn't cleared may have contributed to me
  choosing a path that was more circuitous. I should deally reduce
  clutter, but if I do happen to be in a situation of clutter, I need
  to adjust my movements to be slower.

* Rough edges: Not all impacts are the same. An impact against a
  smooth edge may just be a minor irritation; an impact against a
  rough edge may lead to bleeding. As much as possible I should
  proactively identify rough edges and take actions such as applying
  tape or other protective stuff so that even if I hit the area, the
  damage is comparable to the damage of hitting a smooth surface.
