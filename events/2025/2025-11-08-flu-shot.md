## Appointment booking

I booked my appointment for the flu shot on Saturday 2025-11-01. The
appointment was for Saturday 2025-11-08 at 3 PM at the Walgreens 2801
Adeline St location

I normally book flu shot appointments for Friday, so that I have the
weekend to recover. This time, however, I decided to do Saturday,
because I booked a DEXA scan on Friday. My hope was to benefit from
overlap between the preparatory steps for both, including the pausing
of strength exercises the prior day, and also benefit from the timing
(I picked a week when I am not on-call, so that I don't need to do
overrides for either).

Right after booking the appointment, I completed the consent form steps.

## Prior preparation

### Calendar reminders and other steps on 2025-11-01

* I created the calendar event for the period from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM
  on 2025-11-08 and also invited my work email address.

* I created a maintenance window for the period from 10 AM to 7:30 PM
  on 2025-11-08.

* I didn't have to do any on-call overrides as I am not on-call for
  any rotations.

* It's a Saturday so I don't have work calendar events or Slack
  reminders.

* I already have a shopping reminder for two days prior, thanks to
  DEXA.

* I created a calendar reminder for a weather check in the evening on
  Thursday 2025-11-06.

* I already have a reminder to skip all exercise on Thursday
  2025-11-06, and I anyway won't be doing exercise on Friday
  2025-11-07, so I don't need a separate reminder to skip exercises
  for two days prior to the flu shot (this sharing was part of the
  reason I wanted to do these appointments on consecutive days).

* I added reminders to resume strength exercises: left hand hand
  gripper (4 days), right hand hand gripper (7 days), other strength
  exercises (9 days).

* I added reminders to update records, one for the day after and one
  to check CDPH and Walgreens records 4 days after.

* I added a reminder to pause jogging and breath holds the morning of
  the appointment.

* I added a reminder to resume jogging and breath holds 3 days after
  the vaccine.

* I added a packing/prep reminder for the night before the vaccine.

### Skipping of all exercises starting 2025-11-06 (two days before the flu shot)

I skipped all exercises starting two days before the flu shot. Whereas
a flu shot only necessitates skipping strength exercises starting two
days prior, the juxtaposition with the DEXA scan on 2025-11-07 ended
up leading me to skip all exercises.

### Shopping trip in the late afternoon / early evening on 2025-11-06 (two days before the flu shot)

I completed my Trader Joe's shopping trip in the late afternoon /
early evening of 2025-11-06, so that I didn't have to do a shopping
trip with a lot of heavy lifting shortly before or after the flu shot.

### Weather check in the evening on 2025-11-06 (two days before the flu shot)

I checked the weather in the evening on 2025-11-06. The forecast for
2025-11-08 was for 0% probability of rain, and a temperature of around
70-71 degrees Fahrenheit, which is great.
