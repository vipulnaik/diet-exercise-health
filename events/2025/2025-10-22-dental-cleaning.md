I have a dental cleaning appointment on Wednesday 2025-10-22 at Total
Health Dental Care at 3017 Telegraph Avenue for a regular dental
cleaning at 1 PM. The previous dental cleaning had been on

## Prior preparation

### Appointment set on 2025-04-16 at end of previous dental cleaning

My appointment was set onf Wednesday 2025-04-16 at the end of the
[previous dental cleaning](2025-04-16-dental-cleaning.md).

### Creation of calendar event, reminders etc. on 2025-04-17

On Thursday 2025-04-17, I created the calendar event and reminders and
also created the doc for this dental cleaning appointment.

### Review of schedules / overrides and maintenance windows on 2025-10-09

On Thursday 2025-10-09, one day after the originally scheduled date of
Wednesday 2025-10-08, I reviewed the schedules and maintenance
windows. The maintenance window I had already created was sufficient,
and per the on-call schedule I was already not on-call for either the
infrastructure service or the customer service, so I didn't need to
take further action.

### Acknowledgement of guidance to limit outside foods and phase out cayenne pepper on 2025-10-09

On Thursday 2025-10-09, I reviewed and acknowledged the guidance to
limit outside foods and phase out cayenne pepper. My plan is as
follows:

* For cayenne pepper, I plan to maintain the existing low quantity for
  the immediate next eggplant meal prep and then go to half the
  quantity for the next potatoes prep, and then not use cayenne pepper
  at all for subsequent preps until after the dental cleaning.

* I don't plan to eat out until the dental cleaning. I also plan to
  pause consumption of the red chutney from the previous eating out
  until a week after the dental cleaning.

Overall, this time around, I have not had sore throat issues of the
sort I have had in the month or two leading up to the dental cleaning,
so I can be a bit more adventurous, while still maintaining a healthy
amount of caution.
