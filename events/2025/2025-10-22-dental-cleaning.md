# 2025-10-22: dental cleaning

I had a dental cleaning appointment on Wednesday 2025-10-22 at Total
Health Dental Care at 3017 Telegraph Avenue for a regular dental
cleaning at 1 PM. The previous dental cleaning had been on
[2025-04-16](2025-04-16-dental-cleaning.md).

TODO: As of Sunday 2025-11-02, two things are pending, both of which I
have calendar reminders for:

* Dental self-exam checklist execution for after the dental cleaning
* Scheduling of calendar reminders associated with the next dental cleaning

## Prior preparation

### Appointment set on 2025-04-16 at end of previous dental cleaning

My appointment was set onf Wednesday 2025-04-16 at the end of the
[previous dental cleaning](2025-04-16-dental-cleaning.md).

### Creation of calendar event, reminders etc. on 2025-04-17

On Thursday 2025-04-17, I created the calendar event and reminders and
also created the doc for this dental cleaning appointment.

### Review of schedules / overrides and maintenance windows on 2025-10-09

On Thursday 2025-10-09, one day after the originally scheduled date of
Wednesday 2025-10-08, I reviewed the schedules and maintenance
windows. The maintenance window I had already created was sufficient,
and per the on-call schedule I was already not on-call for either the
infrastructure service or the customer service, so I didn't need to
take further action.

### Acknowledgement of guidance to limit outside foods and phase out cayenne pepper on 2025-10-09

On Thursday 2025-10-09, I reviewed and acknowledged the guidance to
limit outside foods and phase out cayenne pepper. My plan is as
follows:

* For cayenne pepper, I plan to maintain the existing low quantity for
  the immediate next eggplant meal prep and then go to half the
  quantity for the next potatoes prep, and then not use cayenne pepper
  at all for subsequent preps until after the dental cleaning.

  UPDATE 2025-10-21: I ended up using a small amount of cayenne pepper
  with the eggplant meal prep on 2025-10-13 and skipping it entirely
  with the potatoes prep of 2025-10-15 and the eggplant meal prep of
  2025-10-19. See the comments at the start of the respective meal
  prep blocks in
  [food_preparations_and_openings_2025.sql](../../sql/food_preparations_and_openings_2025.sql)
  for more information.

* I don't plan to eat out until the dental cleaning. I also plan to
  pause consumption of the red chutney from the previous eating out
  until a week after the dental cleaning.

Overall, this time around, I have not had sore throat issues of the
sort I have had in the month or two leading up to the dental cleaning,
so I can be a bit more adventurous, while still maintaining a healthy
amount of caution.

### Appointment confirmation on 2025-10-12

On Sunday 2025-10-12, I responded affirmatively to an automated email
message asking me to confirm the appointment.

### Acknowledgement of guidance to probe and be more careful on 2025-10-13

On Monday 2025-10-13, I acknowledged the guidance (that I was reminded
of by the calendar reminder) to probe and be more careful leading up
to the dental cleaning. The idea was to identify mouth bites and mouth
ulcers to avoid aggravating them unnecessarily ahead of the dental
cleaning, as the sharp instruments used in the dental cleaning had the
potential to further aggravate them.

Fortunately, there were no biting incidents or mouth ulcers in the
period from 2025-10-13 to the dental cleaning. Overall, per my private
notes, I have had only one biting incident (on 2025-07-10) and one
non-specific mouth ulcer (on 2025-09-10) since the last dental
cleaning.

### Aborted pause of sauerkraut and walnuts (2025-10-15 to 2025-10-19)

On Wednesday 2025-10-15, I paused sauerkraut consumption ahead of the
dental cleaning, to reduce the risk of mouth ulcers. The calendar
reminder had been for Tuesday 2025-10-14, but I delayed the pause by
one day.

On Thursday 2025-10-16, I finished my walnuts packet with the first
meal, and decided to pause walnuts consumption with the second meal,
to reduce the risk of mouth bites, injuries, and ulcers. The calendar
reminder had been for the morning of Thursday 2025-10-16, so I paused
only one meal later than the reminder.

However, on Sunday, 2025-10-19, after two days of low stool volume,
and after crunching data that showed that the walnut stoppage had
resulted in a huge drop in my total food intake, I decided to resume
both sauerkraut and walnuts, while continuing to probe and be careful
around food consumption. I resumed both with my first meal.

More details are in [food_pauses.sql](../../sql/food_pauses.sql).

On Tuesday 2025-10-21, I updated best practices going forward to
incorporate the learnings from recent experience.

### Filling in of forms (sent via email) on 2025-10-21

On Tuesday 2025-10-21, in the morning, I received a few forms from
Total Health Dental Care to fill in prior to the appointment. I saw
the email and filled in the forms in the early afternoon. It's good
that I got these in advance, because historically I've had to fill the
forms in on my phone at the location, which is less convenient.

### Skipping of fermentable foods starting 2025-10-21 (the day before the appointment)

I finished my potatoes/peas prep with the second meal on Monday
2025-10-20, and held off on doing the next round of prep until after
the dental cleaning appointment. This means that I didn't eat much by
way of fermentable foods (other than a little bit of sauerkraut on the
morning of Tuesday 2025-10-21) in either meal on Tuesday 2025-10-21,
and I had no fermentable foods in the first meal on Wednesday
2025-10-22, shortly before the appointment.

### Normal face shaving on 2025-10-21

I completed normal face shaving on Tuesday 2025-10-21 around 4:30 PM,
so that I had a good starting point for a more thorough face shaving
on the morning of Wednesday 2025-10-22.

### Grocery shopping on 2025-10-21

I completed grocery shopping from Trader Joe's on Tuesday 2025-10-21,
so that I had my potatoes and peas ready to prep after returning from
the dental cleaning appointment on Wednesday 2025-10-22. This was
based on past experience where going out shopping after the
appointment and then cooking after that turned into a very long day.

### Dental self-exam checklist execution on 2025-10-21

I executed the dental self-exam checklist. I did most of the checklist
around noon, but took the photos at around 10:30 PM. This provides a
before for the before/after of the dental cleaning, and helps me
understand the state of my teeth going into the dental cleaning
appointment.

### Packing / prep on 2025-10-21 night

I confirmed that I did not need to do any special preparation for the
dental cleaning appointment. I did do a bit of preparatory
optimization.

### Additional steps the morning of the dental cleaning (2025-10-22)

As marked through calendar reminders, I took these additional steps on
the morning of the dental cleaning:

* I skipped walnuts and sauerkraut with the meal, to reduce the risk
  of minor injuries that could get exacerbated during the dental
  cleaning.

* I skipped exercise to conserve time and energy for the dental
  cleaning.

* I did a thorougher-than-usual round of face shaving, to reduce te
  risk of facial hair getting in the way of dental instrument use.

## Appointment

### Timeline of journey

* 12:01 PM: I started getting ready to close for the trip (i.e., I
  started doing the checklist of final checks on my laptop).

* 12:04 PM: I closed for the trip.

* 12:2? PM: I left my apartment.

* 12:38 PM: I arrived at the office.

* 12:39 PM: I finished check-in with the remote receptionist and sat
  down to wait for the appointment.

### Next appointment

My next appointment was automatically scheduled for Wednesday
2026-04-29 at 1 PM even while I was waiting for the appointment to
start. I got the email message about it at 12:52 PM.

### Getting set in the dental chair

Around 1 PM (I didn't note the exact time) I was called in by the
hygienist. The hygienist was different from the hygienists I have had
so far, so we were new to each other. I put my bag down and got in the
dental chair.

She made me put on the protective glasses (goggles) and put the
protective cloth over my neck area.

Unlike the other hygienist, she did not ask me to do a mouthwash rinse
before starting.

### Initial examination by hygienist

The hygienist looked in my mouth and noted that there was a little
more gum inflammation on the lower front teeth than expected.

As I already had X-rays taken in the last appointment, no additional
X-rays were taken.

### Cleaning sequence by hygienist

The hygienist began by doing scaling with irrigation first, and then
later switched to scaling without irrigation. Unlike one of the other
hygienists, she did not apply the prophy cup polish prior to the
scaling.

### Examination by dentist

The dentist came to examine the teeth after a few minutes of scaling
by the hygienist. My gums had not reacted well to the scaling so far,
though they were not yet bleeding.

The dentist commented on the inflammation as well, which by this point
had been exacerbated by the initial cleaning. Even though the cleaning
had exacerbated the inflammation, the dentist considered this out of
the norm of what should happen to healthy gums even with the use of
cleaning instruments. In my experience as well, the gums were reacting
worse to the cleaning than they had to prior cleanings.

The dentist also mentioning plaque overall and staining on the back
teeth.

The dentist asked about my brushing and flossing practices. No clear
issues were found, so she suggested just continuing as is, and asked
the hygienist to give me more technique-related tips based on her
findings.

The dentist didn't comment on the recession that she normally comments
on. I don't think the recession got better, so it may be that when
there is inflammation, that gets more focus and there's no comment on
the recession.

### Continued cleaning by hygienist

The hygienist continued to clean. Toward the latter half of the
cleaning, there was a steady stream of slight bleeding, which was
unusual for me and also puzzling to the hygienist.

After the cleaning, the hygienist did the prophy cup polishing. She
also mentioned that she had been more thorough with the cleaning than
usual, because of the greater inflammation.

There was no ozone treatment.

### Tips from hygienist

The hygienist recommended that when flossing, I should jiggle in each
tooth a little more rather than just go in and out, to make sure that
each tooth gets cleaned properly.

For brushing, she recommended paying more attention to the area where
the gum and teeth meet.

## Immediate aftermath

### Quick notes, examination of teeth with intra-oral mirror, bleeding with interdental brush

The unexpected findings in the dental cleaning gave me a lot to think
about, but I did not have a lot of time to fully organize my
thoughts. So, after getting home, I spent an hour thinking through and
jotting down a rough version of my thoughts, to be fleshed out later
(and as a result, I also delayed the documentation of the dental
cleaning trip itself).

At around 4:30 PM, I did an examination of the teeth using an
intra-oral mirror, and did a round of cleaning with the interdental
brush. I noticed there was still a bit of bleeding. In light of this,
I decided it was wise to continue pausing walnuts with my evening
meal.

### Gum bleeding again when flossing after evening meal

Some time around 10 PM, when flossing after my evening meal, I noticed
a bit more bleeding. My logs say I used the interdental brush, though
I normally use the floss pick at this time -- it's possible I used the
interdental brush due to the gums being more sensitive and the floss
pick being a bit more aggressive? The logs might also be inaccurate.

### Resumption of walnuts the next day

On Thursday 2025-10-23, based on a subjective sense that my teeth were
feeling better, I resumed consumption of walnuts. I continued to hold
off on the sauerkraut.

### Resumption of sauerkraut two days later

On Friday 2025-10-24, based on a subjective sense that my teeth were
feeling better and my mouth was okay overall, I resumed consumption of
sauerkraut.

### Further gum bleeding with evening flossing two days later

On Friday 2025-10-24, when flossing using the floss pick at around 9
PM, after my second meal, I had slight bleeding from my lower right
teeth, likely the rightmost teeth. This was the last of the bleeding I
noticed in connection with the dental cleaning.

### Minor mouth ulcer

I noticed a mouth ulcer when brushing teeth on Sunday 2025-10-26 past
midnight from Saturday 2025-10-25. Here are my private notes:

> I noticed when probing my mouth after brushing teeth at night, a
> mouth ulcer below my lower right lip. It didn't hurt and I only
> moved it by probing. It is likely related to the inflammation and
> trauma of cleaning and may have also been exacerbated by minor
> walnut impacts nearby (which didn't cause sensations beyond a few
> seconds).

Occasional mouth ulcers are normal for me, and my overall frequency of
mouth ulcers has been lower in the past few months than they were
earlier. I didn't take any special action and it resolved on its
own. Nonetheless, I am noting it here as it falls under the aftermath
of the dental cleaning.

### Stuff I avoided: excess salivation and head/neck/shoulder soreness

I've had an issue of excess salivation with a [past dental
cleaning](../2024/2024-04-03-dental-cleaning.md), that I attributed to
keeping my mouth open too wide and for too long. I was careful during
this dental cleaning to not do so, and I also took care to not talk
too much, and to drink enough water, for the next two days.

I have also in the past had minor issues with head and neck stiffness
for the day after the dental cleaning, likely due to being in an
awkward posture for a long time. This time, I happened to have a
reasonably long walking trip after the dental cleaning, and in general
was able to avoid much head and neck stiffness.

### Resumption of cayenne pepper

I continued skipping cayenne pepper in the meal preps on 2025-10-22
(right after the dental cleaning) and 2025-10-26. I reintroduced
cayenne pepper on 2025-10-30, 8 days after the dental cleaning, by
which point I was reasonably confident that my mouth had fully healed.

## Further reflection and practice updates

NOTE: This section was written on Sunday 2025-11-02, 11 days after the
dental cleaning, but based on bullet points written immediately after
the dental cleaning, further refined over the next few days.

The unexpectedly negative results of the dental cleaning left me
pondering what had changed, and what I should do differently going
forward. Some of the improvements going forward may not specifically
target things that changed, but may be good ideas anyway. Others may
be specifically driven by what changed.

### In what ways were things worse?

Before digging into what might have caused things to get worse, it's
helpful to try to articulate whether and how the results were
worse. There are a few concrete ways:

* The evaluation by the dentist and hygienist was worse than usual.

* I experienced more pain and bleeding with the dental cleaning.

Still, it's hard to separate out three ways things could be worse:

* Was there more plaque (and staining)?

* Was there more gum inflammation in general for a comparable level of
  plaque, due to other changes?

* Was the sample time bad for some reason, i.e., things just happened
  to be a bit more inflamed on the date of the dental cleaning?

It's hard to separate out the different hypotheses, because commentary
by the dentist and hygienist can be influenced by what they happen to
notice first. For instance, if they see more inflammation, they may
comment more on the same level of plaque (because it's having worse
effects). It's also hard to separate between a general increase in
inflammation and some factors that caused increased inflammation on
that specific day.

Overall, the margin of difference, while seemingly big for me, is
still within the gingivitis range and not getting into the
periodontitis range.

Fortunately, I do have self-photos (something that I wasn't sure I
should spend time on given the overall time crunch, but in hindsight
I'm glad I took).

#### What do the self-photos show?

I took self-photos on 2025-04-14, two days before the dental cleaning
on 2025-04-16. I also took self-photos on 2025-10-21, one day before
the dental cleaning on 2025-10-22.

I have also taken self-photos in the past on 2024-10-07 (before the
2024-10-09 dental cleaning) and on 2024-10-09, 2024-10-29, and
2025-02-23.

This past 6-month period has been more hectic in other ways and I
didn't take any self-photos between the cleaning on 2025-04-16 and the
photos on 2025-10-21, right before the next dental cleaning. For
comparison, my goal is to take photos every 2 months (a goal I almost
met last time, though I missed the December photos).

This means that it's hard to compare the progression of plaque and
staining. However, I can compare the right-before-cleaning versions.

* I can first look at my [dental self-exam checklist
  log](../../logs/dental-self-exam-checklist-log.md), where I noted
  down my impressions after the photos (and without the benefit of
  additional feedback from the dental cleaning). My comments on
  2025-10-21 were basically that things were comparable to
  2025-04-14. In other words, without the additional feedback, I
  didn't think there was any clear difference in pattern.

* I took another look after the 2025-10-22 dental cleaning, with the
  benefit of the additional feedback, but still did not see a clear
  difference in the photos.

* I asked another person to compare the two sets of photos (without
  telling them about the additional feedback from the dental
  cleaning). The other person found the photos fairly similar, but
  noted two areas (front top left, back bottom left) where there was a
  bit more plaque this time. I was able to confirm this in the
  photos. Even with the benefit of this other person's feedback,
  though, the differences seem small.

This does suggest to me that there isn't much difference in visible
plaque, but maybe a bit of difference. There may still be differences
in invisible plaque that got under the gumline and is contributing to
inflammation. Or, we might be in one of the other cases (increased
inflammation for comparable level of plaque, or a bad sample time).

#### Pressure testing as an indicator but also a confounding cause

The one thing I remember finding a bit different when I did the dental
self-exam on 2025-10-21 was the results of pressure testing. Here are my notes:

> I experienced a little bit of pain for a few seconds from the use of
> the floss pick when pressed hard against the gums. The pain was more
> in some areas than others -- the upper right and upper middle had
> somewhat sharper pain. Overall, the pain subsided within a few
> seconds. The pushing actions did not cause pain

The notes don't make it super-clear but my subjective sense is that
this was notable worse than 2025-04-14.

Interestingly, this was my first time noticing any gum pain symptoms,
and it was the day before the dental cleaning and a direct result of
pressure testing!

This suggests that the pressure testing might be a good gauge of gum
inflammation and gum health issues. But, it also raises the
possibility that the pressure testing itself might be creating an
effect of inflaming the gums more for a day or two, and that might
have contributed to the inflammation noticed during dental
cleaning. The last two times, I did the dental self-exam checklist
*two days* prior to the dental cleaning, rather than one day prior, so
there was more scope for healing from the pressure testing.

Going forward, my plan is to make sure to do the dental self-exam
checklist every two months, but also to make sure that I execute the
denatl self-exam checklist about a week prior to the dental
cleaning. In particular, the pressure testing portion should be done a
week before the dental cleaning, so that any short-term effects of the
pressure testing are fully reversed by the time of the cleaning. The
margin of one week also allows me to take any additional actions (such
as a more informed decision regarding whether to pause sauerkraut and
walnuts).

#### Other mouth health symptoms

The puzzling thing is that in most ways, my mouth health was
subjectively better in this 6-month period than other 6-month periods
between cleanings:

* Way less by way of mouth ulcers, biting incidents, and throat
  soreness than the past two times

* Way less masseter muscle tension even during massage for most of the
  period (I only started feeling masseter muscle soreness in the 1-2
  weeks prior to the dental cleaning, whereas in the past it’s been
  present throughout)

* No tooth pain and gum bleeding (outside of during dental self-exam),
  normally I might have 1 or 2 minor incidents of gum bleeding

#### Confounding factor of hygienist technique

I had a new hygienist this time, whose technique was likely somewhat
different (for instance, no mouthwash rinse, prophy cup at end) and
who also likely less familiar with some aspects of my mouth type. The
hygienist also decided to be extra thorough which added to the extent
of exposure to the dental instruments, potentially exacerbating
bleeding.

The dentist only saw my gums after the hygienist had already worked on
them for a little bit.

Overall, I don't think this was a major factor driving a difference in
my experience, but it is a confounding consideration when interpreting
the details.

#### Overall synthesis of the data

My overall take is that there's weak evidence supporting the idea of
more plaque, particularly invisible plaque, but not by a huge
margin. There may also be some other factor causing more inflammation
in general. The dental self-exam's pressure testing portion might have
exacerbated by inflammation situation, causing a bad sample time for
the dental cleaning. All these considerations inform my best practices
going forward.

### Ways my dental practices changed (for better and worse) and how those might have contributed

I made a few deliberate changes to my dental practices. There were
also some drifts in practices, particularly as relates to timing and
technique, though it's hard to clearly say whether and how much they
got worse. Let's break it down.

#### Switch to ultra soft toothbrush: potentially causal in making things worse

As documented
[here](2025-04-01-use-of-perio-toothbrush-and-baking-soda-toothpaste.md),
I switched from a soft toothbrush to an ultra soft toothbrush on
2025-04-01. This was about two weeks prior to the previous dental
cleaning on 2025-04-16, so the 2025-10-22 dental cleaning is the first
dental cleaning where I was on an ultra soft toothbrush throughout;
the two weeks for the previous dental cleaning don't count.

My reasoning for switching to the ultra soft toothbrush was that it'll
be better at preventing further recession; at the time, recession was
the primary consideration as gum inflammation and plaque seemed to be
under control.

However, the ultra soft toothbrush might be just that little bit less
powerful at sweeping out the plaque, and an exposure over 6 months
might be enough to make things add up.

For now, my thinking about this is:

* I want to stick to the ultra soft toothbrush for a little longer,
  but take other steps to compensate in the areas with more plaque
  accumulation. I hope to get the best of both worlds: sensitive in
  the areas with recession potential, while compensating with more
  thoroughness in areas with more plaque accumulation.

* I may revisit my thinking based on the results of frequent mirror
  checks and 2-month dental self-exam checklist execution.

#### Occasional use of baking soda toothpaste: likely too infrequent to make a meaningful difference

Along with my switch to an ultra soft toothbrush on 2025-04-01, I also
started occasionally using a baking soda toothpaste on my back
teeth. The total number of times between the cleanings I used the
baking soda on my back teeth was about 30 (this was at the lower end
of the range I was targeting).

Based on the staining photos, my guess is that the frequency of
this use was too low to meaningfully make a difference. My plan is to
continue doing this as I don't think it is hurting anything, and
perhaps increase the frequency, but also understand that it's not very
effective even at a somewhat increased frequency.

#### Drift in timing of flossing and rinsing: potentially made things worse

I have generally tried to do flossing and rinsing at the end of
post-meal cleanup, which works out to being about 30 to 60 minutes
after the end of the meal. My current understanding is that about 30
to 60 minutes after the end of the meal is ideal for flossing and
rinsing -- earlier might be a bit too soon, and later might be a bit
too late.

However, in the past few months, I have adopted a practice of
splitting post-meal cleanup into two rounds, with the first round
focused on putting food in the fridge, then a break to check things on
computer and log stuff related to preparations and openings, and then
a second round, usually multiplexed with listening to video and audio
content using my bone conduction headphones.

With this two-round structure, there is a gap in between that delays
the end of post-meal cleanup. While this gap is generally about 10 to
20 minutes, there have been many times over the past few months when
the gap stretches to 30 minutes or more.

On top of that, I have also tried to do more stuff within the bucket
of post-meal cleanup, rather than delaying them to later (as I used to
do).

The net effect is that rinsing and flossing were often getting
delayed to well over an hour after the meal.

This is not a sudden big jump (unlike the toothbrush switch) but more
of a drift over time, with a lot of fluctuation.

#### Drift in technique of flossing, specifically particular missed interdental gaps: potentially made things worse

I think I might over time have developed blind spots of missing
specific interdental gaps when flossing. Not that I miss a specific
interdental gap all the time, but I might be missing a specific
interdental gap like 30% of the time. The specific ones that I think I
have a high risk of missing are the medial interdental gap and the rightmost and
leftmost interdental gaps.

With the middle teeth, the issue is losing track when I switch the
orientation of my handle to transition from teeth on one side to teeth
on the other side.

With the rightmost and leftmost interdental gap (the one between the
two extreme molars) the issue is that it's easy to miss these when
probing around for interdental gaps.

There's some anecdotal evidence, for instance, from the pressure
testing and bleeding patterns, that the middle and rightmost teeth
were among the ones presenting the most problems. With that said, the
problems weren't super-localized, so I don't think this is the whole
story.

While I don't have good data to suggest that my frequency of missing
particular teeth has gone up over time, I do think I was in general
more conscious and thoughtful about the area around the wisdom teeth in
the immediate aftermath of wisdom tooth removal, and in general my
flossing in more recent months has been more on autopilot. In general,
I've taken the attitude that even if I miss a particular interdental
gap once, it's okay because I'll get it next time. But further
reflection suggests that there are particular biases and blind spots
that cause specific gaps to get missed often enough that it
meaningfully affects the cleanliness of those areas.

#### Skipping of dental self-exam checklist: potentially made things worse by not letting me discover the issue sooner

Due to being busy, I didn't execute the dental self-exam checklist
after the dental cleaning or at the 2-month or 4-month mark. This
means that I didn't get early feedback on the situation. I'm not sure
how much that feedback would have changed my trajectory, or if I would
even have noticed any issue at all. But at least combined with my
improved understanding, I expect that sticking to regular execution of
the checklists will be helpful.

#### Differences in protocols shortly before the dental cleaning: potentially made things worse in terms of sample timing

Two things come to mind:

* The pressure testing for the dental self-exam checklist that
  happened the day before the cleaning may have exacerbated the
  inflammation. Going forward, I plan to do the dental self-exam
  checklist a week prior to the dental cleaning.

* I aborted my pause of sauerkraut and walnuts, so I was having these
  right till the day before the dental cleaning. So, if sauerkraut and
  walnuts exacerbate the inflammation, then I might have been looking
  artificially better in past cleanings where I paused these for a few
  days before the dental cleaning. If this is a meaningful
  contributor, then this time's feedback may be more reflective of the
  real situation (though it may still be wise to pause sauerkraut a
  little longer just so the dental cleaning experience is not too
  bad).

### Changes to best practices going forward

On the day of the dental cleaning, I noted down a bunch of ways I plan
to improve my practices going forward, and started implementing
them. Over the next few days, I refined this guidance further.

#### Improvements to practice of getting stuck food out of the mouth immediately after meals

If I notice or feel large food particles stuck in my mouth, I try to
get them out during or after the meal.

My goal is to improve my ability to sense stuck food particles and get
them out during or immediately after the meal, including through
tongue probing, swishing water, etc. The goal is that by the time I do
the formal round of rinsing and flossing, there are no large particles
that come out. This means that if a visible food particle does come
out during the formal round of rinsing and flossing, I should consider
it a failure of the earlier stages.

Comments as of 2025-11-02: I think I'm getting a bit better at this,
but food particles don't get stuck at every meal, so it's hard to
gauge progress. I have, however, not been thinking about this
consciously, and I should make sure to make the post-meal tongue probe
more deliberate.

#### Changes to timing of flossing and rinsing

To combat the issue of potentially large gaps between finishing the
meal and flossing/rinsing, I am changing my post-meal cleanup protocol
as follows: I should target doing the flossing/rinsing at about this
amount of time after meal, in descending order:

* 30 to 45 minutes
* 45 to 60 minutes
* 15 to 30 minutes
* 60 to 75 minutes
* 0 to 15 minutes
* 75 minutes and higher

For most meals, 30 to 45 minutes is relatively easy to do if I put my
mind to it: I simply reorder various pieces of post-meal cleanup so
that the flossing/rinsing naturally falls within the desired
timeframe. If my timing is a bit off, I might leak to 45 to 60
minutes.

In cases where I have a meeting shortly after the meal, that would
mean I miss the window of up to 60 minutes, I should try for 15 to 30
minutes or 0 to 15 minutes. This may mean doing flossing/rinsing right
after putting food in the fridge, without the benefit of multiplexing
with listening to stuff, and that's okay. In most cases, these are
pre-identified circumstances.

If something time-sensitive comes up in the inter-meal interlude after
the first part of post-meal cleanup (putting food in fridge) and I
don't want to do the entirety of the second round of post-meal cleanup
until that is addressed, I should still consider breaking up the
remainder of post-meal cleanup into two parts, with one part focused
on flossing/rinsing and the second part for the more optional elements
of cleanup. If I have time to squeeze in the flossing/rinsing part, I
should do so.

Comments as of 2025-11-02: Overall, I think I've been able to adhere
to this timing practice pretty well, hitting 30 to 45 minutes almost
always when there's nothing time-sensitive after the meal, with
occasional delays to 45 to 60 minutes. I have done the 0 to 15 minutes
and 15 to 30 minutes a few times when there was a meeting or scheduled
event after the meal, and it's been great because in some cases that
meeting or scheduled event lasted over an hour.

#### Changes within protocol of floss pick and interdental brush use

I am making two protocol changes:

* (expected to add less than 5 seconds on average) Counting
  interdental gaps: I have 14 remaining upper and 14 remaining lower
  teeth, so that's a total of 14 - 1 = 13 gaps. I should make sure to
  count the number of gaps I floss and rinse (separately for upper and
  lower) and make sure I hit that number 13.

  If I get to the end and don't hit the number 13, I should do another
  round more carefully.

* (expected to add about 30 seconds -- about 1 second per interdental
  gap) Jiggling a little bit: This is based on the hygienist
  recommendation. Rather than just going in and out, I should jiggle a
  little bit, particlarly for the teeth on the side where it's hard to
  get the floss pick out, because these are also the ones where food
  can be stuck without going out. Remember to jiggle slowly and gently
  -- the point isn't speed or force, but just multiple passes.

Comments as of 2025-11-02: I have been following the improved protocl
fairly consistently. Based on my experience, the leftmost, rightmost,
and middle interdental gap are the ones most at risk of being missed.

#### Changes within protocol of brushing teeth

I am making several minor protocol changes:

* (expected to add 30 to 60 seconds) Rather than start with the front
  teeth, I plan to start with the back teeth, and alternatingly start
  with the upper and lower back teeth (expected to add 30 to 60
  seconds): The teeth one starts with get the most toothpaste and also
  the best effort, and my back teeth are the ones that have been
  lagging in general. Moreover, I still plan to come back to the back
  teeth after the front teeth, so this effectively means I get about
  twice the number of rounds on the back teeth as the front
  teeth. This proportion seems better suited to the relative rates of
  plaque accumulation and staining. This also has the advantage that
  the front teeth are easier to see, so giving more attention to the
  back teeth helps offset the advantage the front teeth have.

* (expected to add 30 seconds) At the end, after brushing my tongue
  and doing a light run over my cheeks, I plan to do an additional
  round focused only on the gums (back and front) focusing on the
  gum-tooth interface and on the gums beyond the teeth (the earlier
  rounds also cover the gums, but only in passing from the
  teeth). This cleans the gums and also keeps me better informed of
  issues with the gums.

#### Changes to baking soda toothpaste protocol

I am not planning to make any changes to the baking soda toothpaste
protocol, other than probably a slight increase in frequency. I'm
aiming for something like once every 3 to 4 days on average, which
should translate to about 45 to 60 rounds (over a period of a bit over
180 days) as opposed to the 30 I did this time. With that said, I
don't expect the baking soda toothpaste to be a major driver of
greater tooth cleanliness, and should not expect it to bail me out.

#### Changes to periodic checks

* I plan to check the state of my back teeth regularly (just using a
  normal mirror with the mouth wide open), perhaps not every time I
  brush, but once every 1 to 2 days at least.

* I'm planning to do the intra-oral mirror check about once a week and
  document having done it in my Slack self-chat logs. The intra-oral
  mirror check is fairly quick compared to the full dental self-exam,
  and it should be enough to provide initial warning signs of plaque
  and staining. It also means that if for some reason I don't get time
  to do the full dental self-exam checklist, I am still moderately
  aware of the situation with my back teeth.

* I plan to stick to the intended 2-month frequency for the dental
  self-exam checklist. If it's daunting to do it all at once, I should
  do it in separate pieces (pressure testing and photos can be done
  separately).

* Interdental gap pressure testing is diagnostically helpful but can
  also exacerbate issues, so I should do it carefully and not too
  frequently. About once a month, particularly in the first few months
  after a dental cleaning, can help me get a sense of the worsening
  early on, allowing me to adjust practices. Since it's already in the
  2-month dental self-exam checklist, an additional off-cycle round
  can help provide that additional coverage.

#### Changes to checks before and after the dental cleaning

* I'm moving the dental self-exam checklists before and after the
  cleaning to, respectively, one week before and one week after the
  cleaning. This gives time to process any information gleaned, and
  also time to recover from any temporary exacerbation of
  inflammation. I'm reflecting these updates in the [best practices
  doc](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-dental-cleaning-appointments.md).

## Later actions

### Dental self-exam checklist execution on 2025-11-05

On Wednesday 2025-11-05, two weeks after the dental cleaning, I
executed the dental self-exam checklist and logged the execution
[here](../../logs/dental-self-exam-checklist-log.md#2025-11-05). Things
were mostly normal; in particular, the pressure testing results were
better. However, I am concerned about there still being plaque on the
back top right teeth, so that's an area I plan to pay more attention
to when brushing.
