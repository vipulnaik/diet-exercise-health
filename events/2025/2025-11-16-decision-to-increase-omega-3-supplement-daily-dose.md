# 2025-11-16: decision to increase omega-3 supplement daily dose

On Sunday 2025-11-16, I decided to increase the daily dose of my
omega-3 supplement.

Prior to this, I was taking two softgels per day, both with my first
meal, one from Freshfield (DHA + DPA) and one from sapling (DHA +
EPA).

Going forward, I'll continue to take both softgels with my first meal,
but will also add a single softgel with my second meal, alternating
between Freshfield and sapling. This means that on average I'll have
1.5 Freshfield softgels per day and 1.5 sapling softgels per day.

The goal is primarily to increase my DHA consumption, in light of
supposed benefits of DHA for brain health. Even with the increase, my
total DHA consumption is still far below the level where brain health
benefits level off. I'm also interesting in seeing if the EPA
consumption increase results in any benefits to my lipid management
(particularly the triglycerides and HDL cholesterol).
