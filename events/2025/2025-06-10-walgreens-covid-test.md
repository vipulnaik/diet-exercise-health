# 2025-06-10: Walgreens COVID test

On Tuesday 2025-06-10, I took an at-home COVID test that I had
purchased from Walgreens (I keep unexpired tests of this sort in stock
all the time) and got a negative result.

You can see a video explaining how to take the test
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WysIeHFQHO4). I watched the
video and read through the instructions that were in the test packet
before starting.

Here is the timeline of my steps:

* 7:58:39 AM: I started wearing gloves after having washed my hands.

* 8:00:18 AM: I had worn the gloves at this point.

* 8:01:13 AM: I had put the tube in its holder in the tray.

* 8:02:04 AM: I had removed the swab from its packaging.

* 8:02:44 AM: I had finished with swabbing my left nostril (4 turns).

* 8:03:07 AM: I had finished with swabbing my right nostril (4 turns).

* 8:03:29 AM: I had put the swab in the tube and stirred it 3 to 4 times.

* 8:04:30 AM: I started the process of removing the swab from the tube.

* 8:05:00 AM: I had finished removing the swab, squeezing it against
  the edges to drain it, and putting the used swab in the trash.

* 8:08:30 AM: I had placed the test strip in the tube. This took a
  little longer than anticipated because with gloves I had trouble
  tearing the packaging of the test strip (while being careful not to
  damage the strip) and I ended up reaching out for scissors. It's a
  good idea to keep scissors handy in the future.

* 8:14 AM: Around this time, I noticed the blue line starting to form in the test tube.

* 8:19:05 AM: I removed the test strip from the tube.

I saw a blue line and no red line, thereby giving a clear negative
result for the test. I took a photo of the test strip for future
reference. I waited until around 8:24 AM (with the test strip outside
the tube) to confirm that no red line built up.

By 8:26 AM, I had trashed all the used components (test strip, tube,
cap of tube, and packing). I retained the instructions, the tray, and
the stuff for the second test. I put them all back in the packaging
and stowed the packaging away.
