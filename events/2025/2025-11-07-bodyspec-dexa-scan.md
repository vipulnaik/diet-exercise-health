## General background

I first became familiar with the idea of DEXA scans around October
2024. My digital trails show me first discussing and browsing the
concept on October 13 (2024-10-13) though it's possible I came across
the idea prior to that.

On 2024-10-14, I created a [first
pass](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/9fa1e9fe6066634f1d52e7f697b926d4bb6ff099)
of my list of things to investigate, and included DEXA. At the time, I
identified BodySpec as a candidate place to get a DEXA scan.

At that time, I wasn't sure exactly when I would get around to doing the DEXA scan.

On 2024-11-13, I [started putting together](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/6197c5993994bb79ed603f8f2998fb66c01573c3) a list of best practices around DEXA scans, in preparation for potentially doing the scan soon. However, on 2024-11-15, I [decided to
delay](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/444e1a9773adbbd2bd9ace0d82308f326f3c00fc)
the DEXA scan to May/June 2025, as things were getting a bit busy.

I ended up traveling to India in May/June 2025, and then getting busy
with other things, so the DEXA ended up getting deferred. In late
October 2025, I decided that it's best to get the DEXA done before we
get too deep into winter. Winter is less pleasant both due to rain
(making it harder to schedule a rain-free travel day) and a greater
load of cyclic personal chores due to greater appetite. Therefore, I
started the process of booking my appointment.

## Appointment booking

### Initial appointment booking on Thursday 2025-10-30 for Sunday 2025-11-09

Since the BodySpec DEXA scan location is open on weekends, my initial
inclination was to book on a Sunday, reducing the risk of any
conflicts with other things.

On Thursday 2025-10-30, I booked the appointment for Sunday 2025-11-09
12:15 PM PST. This factored in that my time for preparation and travel
was around 3 hours 45 minutes, meaning I would need to wake up by
around 8:30 AM. It also factored in the daylight saving switch between
my time of booking and the time of the appointment, so that 8:30 AM
would map to the current 9:30 AM, and my waking up time is currently
comfortably prior to 9:30 AM except on days where I sleep quite late
(something I plan to not do in the days leading up to the
appointment).

While booking, I checked weather conditions in both Berkeley and San
Francisco on the day. The higher probability of rain was in San
Francisco at about 22%, which I considered reasonable.

I also confirmed the cancellation and rescheduling policy when
booking. Any cancellation more than 24 hours prior to the appointment
gave me a credit to book a new appointment. I considered this
sufficiently flexible, considering that I did plan to get a DEXA at
some point, so even if things changed in the near future and I
cancelled my other plans, the credit would be useful later.

After finishing the booking, I filled in and submitted the intake
form. I saved a PDF of the filled intake form prior to signing and
submission.

I also used their button to add the event to my calendar. The
appointment duration as added to calendar was 12:15 PM to 12:27 PM.

### Switch on Saturday 2025-11-01 to Friday 2025-11-07 based on weather forecast

On the night of Friday 2025-10-31, as part of the night-time 10-day
weather review, I noticed an increase in the probability of rain for
Sunday 2025-11-09, in both Berkeley and San Francisco. This led me to
mull moving the appointment to Friday 2025-11-07.

The next morning, Saturday 2025-11-01, I switched the appointment to
Friday 2025-11-07 12:15 PM PST. To do this, I first cancelled the
original appointment, then used the credit from it to book the new
appointment.

I was prompted to fill in the intake form again, so I filled it
in. BodySpec's interface doesn't seem to allow me to view the filled
intake form or even see a confirmation that it has been filled, but my
browsing history does show me as having visited the done page. I also
saved a PDF of the filled and signed intake form (right before
submission). I also did a PDF diff to confirm that I had filled the
same data both times.

I also used their button to add the event to my calendar. The
appointment duration as added to calendar was 12:15 PM to 12:27 PM,
same as for the now-cancelled appointment. Later, I removed the
similarly added event for the original appointment time.

## Prior preparation

### Calendar reminders and other steps on 2025-11-01

I took the following preparatory steps:

* I created a calendar reminder from 7 AM to 4 PM for the day of the
  DEXA scan. I also invited my work email address.

* I set a maintenance window for most alert services where I am
  primary for the period starting 9 PM the previous night and going to
  5:30 PM. I also updated the general guidance for best practices
  around various medical appointments; with the new guidance, I start
  the maintenance window at 9 PM the previous night for any
  appointments that are 2 PM or earlier, thereby reducing the chances
  of being woken up at night and having a disrupted sleep.

* The appointment time had been chosen at a time when I am not on-call
  in rotations, so no on-call override coordination was needed.

* I set 6 calendar reminders around sleep and alarms: 3 to set alarms
  at reasonable times on the three days prior (8:30 AM and 8:45 AM)
  and three to go to sleep early on those three days.

* I set a calendar reminder to finish my meal by around 8:15 PM the
  night prior to the DEXA scan.

* I set a shopping reminder for the day before the DEXA scan. While
  I'd normally set this to 2 days before, there's a forecast of rain
  for 2 days before so that's not practical.

* I set a calendar reminder to check both weather and BART two days
  prior to the appointment.

* I set calendar reminders to pause supplements two days prior and one
  day prior to the DEXA scan.

* I set a calendar reminder to skip exercise the day prior to the
  appointment (2025-11-06).

* I set a packing / prep calendar reminder for the evening prior to
  the appointment (2025-11-06).

### Alarm-setting for the three days prior

I set alarms for 8:30 AM and 8:45 AM for the mornings of Wednesday
2025-11-05 and Thursday 2025-11-06. These were already my default
alarm times, so no adjustment was needed.

On Wednesday 2025-11-05, I woke up at 8:36 AM, choosing to stay in bed
a little past the alarm time of 8:30 AM (by which time I was already
semi-awake).

### Supplement pause starting 2025-11-05

On the evening of Tuesday 2025-11-04, after finishing my second meal,
I put an upside-down plastic bag over the supplements on my table, to
provide a visual cue reminder of my intended pause of supplements
starting Wednesday 2025-11-05.

Starting Wednesday 2025-11-05, I paused all supplements. I continued
the pause on Thursday 2025-11-06. Friday I don't need to do anything
special as I am anyway not eating or exercising before the scan so
there's no natural point for me to have supplements.

### Weather check and BART check in the evening on 2025-11-05 (two days before the scan)

On the evening of Wednesday 2025-11-05, I checked the weather in both
Berkeley and San Francisco for Friday 2025-11-07. It looked fine;
typical moderate weather with low probability of rain in both cities.

I also verified that as of now there were no BART service advisories
for Friday 2025-11-07.

### Skipping of all exercises on 2025-11-06 (one day before the scan)

I skipped all exercises on 2025-11-06, one day before the scan. I'm
also skipping exercises the day of the scan.

### Shopping trip in the late afternoon / early evening on 2025-11-06 (one day before the scan)

I completed my Trader Joe's shopping trip in the late afternoon /
early evening of 2025-11-06, so that I didn't have to do shopping
after returning from the BodySpec DEXA scan.

### Evening meal completion on time on 2025-11-06

I completed my evening meal (last meal of the day) at 7:48 PM,
compared to a target time of 8:15 PM. This means I have 16 hours
between the meal and the DEXA scan.

### Packing / prep in the evening on 2025-11-06

I completed packing / prep ahead of the DEXA scan. This was with the
goal of minimizing scrambling on the morning of the scan.

## Appointment

### Arrival

I arrived at the BodySpec location at 295 Broadway at 11:38 AM, with
37 minutes to spare for my appointment. This early arrival was because
I built in buffers for delays at various points, and the journey
turned out to be smooth without any of the delays.

### Preparation while waiting

At the time of my arrival, there was nobody at the front desk. Both
the radiographers were busy scanning people. So I just sat down and
moved my stuff from my pockets into my backpack as planned. I
completed this process from 11:42 AM to 11:48 AM, then continued to
wait.

One of the radiographers came out and asked for my last name, looked
up my appointment time, and confirmed that everything was good for my
appointment. There were still other people with earlier appointments,
so I continued to wait.

### Scanning

#### Before lying down

Around noon, I was called inside by one of the radiographers.

I was asked to provide my date of birth to confirm my identity. I
think around this time the radiographer also confirmed that this was
my first time with BodySpec.

I deposited my sweatshirt on the tray; everything else I had already
put in the backpack.

I then took off my shoes and sanitized my hands. The radiographer
confirmed that I did not need to take off my socks or scrunchy.

#### Positioning

I was asked to lie down on the DEXA table. These were the
instructions:

* Lie on my back

* Put head under where the scanner is right now

* Align my spine to the white line in the middle

* Keep my hands to my sides in a karate chop position (facing my hips)

* Eyes can be open or closed

While getting into position, my head touched the scanner, but it was a
low-speed impact so it didn't hurt me. Nonetheness, in the future I
should make sure to go lower and crawl in.

It took me a few seconds more than ideal to get into the position, as
I did not fully internalize all aspects completely. The radiographer
confirmed that my position looked good.

#### The actual scanning part of scanning

The scanning occurred one segment at a time, with the machine
proceeding from above my left to above my right. The radiographer kept
informing me of how things were going, with information such as that a
certain area had been completed, or that it was coming up.

At some point before the scanner got to the hand region I fidgeted
with the fingers of my right hand, but without any major arm movement,
and the radiographer did not mention any disruption to the scanning
process. The radiographer did warn me as we got close to the hand,
presumably since this is a regio to be careful with, and I made sure
to stop moving the hand.

Once the hands and trunk area were completed, the radiographer told me
so, with the implication that I can relax those areas, though I
continued to try to stay still.

#### Other conversation during scanning

The radiographer also asked me questions about where I had heard of
BodySpec. I had already answered this question at some point in the
appointment bookng process, but I answered it again here. I *think*
she asked me these questions only after the scanner had completed the
head region, so that my talking wouldn't disrupt the scanning process.

The radiographer also asked me what I was particularly interested
in. I mentioned visceral fat as one area of interest to me.

#### Wrapping up in the DEXA room

The radiographer told me that my scan proceeded smoothly and I should
expect a report from BodySpec in about 10 minutes.

After scanning, I wore my shoes and sanitized my hands. While doing
so, I discussed the frequency of future scanning with the
radiographer. She said quarterly was generally good enough, though she
herself did monthly.

I then took the sweatshirt and backpack and exited the room. The
radiographer also exited with me. I got confirmation that I could hang
out in the waiting area to put stuff back in my pockets.

### Further steps in the waiting area

I put stuff back in my pocket and also updated various checklists
based on my experience today. I then checked my email and saw that the
report had come through. I looked at the report briefly on the
BodySpec site, but wasn't able to peruse it in depth on my phone (and
also, I didn't locate the PDF reports section on the phone, though I
suspected such a section existed).

At 12:26 PM, I left the BodySpec location.

## Report review

### Review immediately after return home on 2025-11-07

After the DEXA scan, I met up for lunch with work colleagues. I got
back home later in the evening. Once back home, I checked the report
more completely and downloaded the PDF version.

I downloaded the PDF report and went through it. There were some
things a little inconsistent between the PDF report and the online
summary. I'm using the PDF report as the more canonical reference.

A fuller review of the data is deferred to later. Here are some of the
main points I noticed, that I expect to reference when doing the
fuller review:

* Not directly about the DEXA results, but more about the image: I
  noticed that my image was leaning slightly to (my) right (so to the
  left in the image). I suspect this was a slight positioning error on
  my part, and it might reflect my general posture having a slight
  lean. I should be more thoughtful about my posture in general and
  also specifically when on the DEXA table. The radiographer probably
  noticed but didn't think it was enough of an issue to affect the
  scan results.

* My visceral fat at 0.15 lbs (0.068 kg, or 68 grams) is pretty low,
  which is good. This resolved concerns I had about visceral fat
  accumulation, which may not be visible but could have adverse health
  impacts.

* My subcutaneous fat is also low; my overall body fat percentage is
  16.3% which is respectable. My A/G ratio is less than 1, which is
  good.

* My muscle and bone mineral density are both low, neither of which is
  good. I feel like in general I am already doing the things that I
  want to do to improve these, including diet, exercise, and
  supplements. Unfortunately, at this point I have only one data
  point, rather than a time series, so I can't figure out the effect
  my diet, exercise, and supplement choices are having over
  time. Hopefully, with additional data points, I'll have a clearer
  picture.

* My right arm has more lean muscle mass than my left arm, but it's
  the other way around for the legs. The arm differences match the
  strength differences between the arms.

### Chatting with their AI the next day (2025-11-08)

I chatted briefly with the AI the next day. It seemed pretty capable
at conversation and at going over my results and coming up with
suggestions, but I did not try it extensively.
