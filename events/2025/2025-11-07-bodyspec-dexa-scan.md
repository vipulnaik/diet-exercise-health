## General background

I first became familiar with the idea of DEXA scans around October
2024. My digital trails show me first discussing and browsing the
concept on October 13 (2024-10-13) though it's possible I came across
the idea prior to that.

On 2024-10-14, I created a [first
pass](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/9fa1e9fe6066634f1d52e7f697b926d4bb6ff099)
of my list of things to investigate, and included DEXA. At the time, I
identified BodySpec as a candidate place to get a DEXA scan.

At that time, I wasn't sure exactly when I would get around to doing the DEXA scan.

On 2024-11-13, I [started putting together](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/6197c5993994bb79ed603f8f2998fb66c01573c3) a list of best practices around DEXA scans, in preparation for potentially doing the scan soon. However, on 2024-11-15, I [decided to
delay](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/444e1a9773adbbd2bd9ace0d82308f326f3c00fc)
the DEXA scan to May/June 2025, as things were getting a bit busy.

I ended up traveling to India in May/June 2025, and then getting busy
with other things, so the DEXA ended up getting deferred. In late
October 2025, I decided that it's best to get the DEXA done before we
get too deep into winter. Winter is less pleasant both due to rain
(making it harder to schedule a rain-free travel day) and a greater
load of cyclic personal chores due to greater appetite. Therefore, I
started the process of booking my appointment.

## Appointment booking

### Initial appointment booking on Thursday 2025-10-30 for Sunday 2025-11-09

Since the BodySpec DEXA scan location is open on weekends, my initial
inclination was to book on a Sunday, reducing the risk of any
conflicts with other things.

On Thursday 2025-10-30, I booked the appointment for Sunday 2025-11-09
12:15 PM PST. This factored in that my time for preparation and travel
was around 3 hours 45 minutes, meaning I would need to wake up by
around 8:30 AM. It also factored in the daylight saving switch between
my time of booking and the time of the appointment, so that 8:30 AM
would map to the current 9:30 AM, and my waking up time is currently
comfortably prior to 9:30 AM except on days where I sleep quite late
(something I plan to not do in the days leading up to the
appointment).

While booking, I checked weather conditions in both Berkeley and San
Francisco on the day. The higher probability of rain was in San
Francisco at about 22%, which I considered reasonable.

I also confirmed the cancellation and rescheduling policy when
booking. Any cancellation more than 24 hours prior to the appointment
gave me a credit to book a new appointment. I considered this
sufficiently flexible, considering that I did plan to get a DEXA at
some point, so even if things changed in the near future and I
cancelled my other plans, the credit would be useful later.

After finishing the booking, I filled in and submitted the intake
form. I saved a PDF of the filled intake form prior to signing and
submission.

I also used their button to add the event to my calendar. The
appointment duration as added to calendar was 12:15 PM to 12:27 PM.

### Switch on Saturday 2025-11-01 to Friday 2025-11-07 based on weather forecast

On the night of Friday 2025-10-31, as part of the night-time 10-day
weather review, I noticed an increase in the probability of rain for
Sunday 2025-11-09, in both Berkeley and San Francisco. This led me to
mull moving the appointment to Friday 2025-11-07.

The next morning, Saturday 2025-11-01, I switched the appointment to
Friday 2025-11-07 12:15 PM PST. To do this, I first cancelled the
original appointment, then used the credit from it to book the new
appointment.

I was prompted to fill in the intake form again, so I filled it
in. BodySpec's interface doesn't seem to allow me to view the filled
intake form or even see a confirmation that it has been filled, but my
browsing history does show me as having visited the done page. I also
saved a PDF of the filled and signed intake form (right before
submission). I also did a PDF diff to confirm that I had filled the
same data both times.

I also used their button to add the event to my calendar. The
appointment duration as added to calendar was 12:15 PM to 12:27 PM,
same as for the now-cancelled appointment. Later, I removed the
similarly added event for the original appointment time.

## Preparation

I took the following preparatory steps:

* I created a calendar reminder from 7 AM to 4 PM for the day of the
  DEXA scan. I also invited my work email address.

* I set a maintenance window for most alert services where I am
  primary for the period starting 9 PM the previous night and going to
  5:30 PM. I also updated the general guidance for best practices
  around various medical appointments; with the new guidance, I start
  the maintenance window at 9 PM the previous night for any
  appointments that are 2 PM or earlier, thereby reducing the chances
  of being woken up at night and having a disrupted sleep.

* The appointment time had been chosen at a time when I am not on-call
  in rotations, so no on-call override coordination was needed.

* I set 6 calendar reminders around sleep and alarms: 3 to set alarms
  at reasonable times on the three days prior (8:30 AM and 8:45 AM)
  and three to go to sleep early on those three days.

* I set a calendar reminder to finish my meal by around 8:15 PM the
  night prior to the DEXA scan.

* I set a shopping reminder for the day before the DEXA scan. While
  I'd normally set this to 2 days before, there's a forecast of rain
  for 2 days before so that's not practical.

* I set a calendar reminder to check both weather and BART two days
  prior to the appointment.

* I set calendar reminders to pause supplements two days prior and one
  day prior to the DEXA scan.

* I set a calendar reminder to skip exercise the day prior to the
  appointment (2025-11-06).

* I set a packing / prep calendar reminder for the evening prior to
  the appointment (2025-11-06).
