[here](2025-01-15-audiological-evaluation.md). On the way back, I

## 2025-01-22

I went to the LabCorp location at 3100 San Pablo Ave for a blood
draw. See

## 2025-01-23

On Thursday 2025-01-23, I made a trip to downtown Berkeley. My first
stop was at Citibank, where I did a few financial transactions,
including withdrawing quarters for laundry. I then went to Trader
Joe's for food purchases recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql).

## 2025-01-26

In addition to my food purchases recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql), I also stopped at a few
ATMs: I stopped at the Allpoint ATM in the Walgreens on Adeline Street
before my Berkeley Bowl trip, and I stopped at the Chase and Wells
Fargo ATMs on Shattuck Avenue (near Center Street) on the way to
Trader Joe's.

## 2025-02-01

In the evening, I made a trip to Trader Joe's for grocery shopping;
the purchases are recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql). As it was raining lightly,
and I didn't want my purchased food to get too wet on the way back, I
decided to take BART back (from downtown Berkeley BART to Ashby BART)
instead of walking back (which is what makes the trip worthy of
recording in the activity tracker).

## 2025-02-21

On Friday 2025-02-21, in the evening, I made a long-overdue trip to
the Walgreens at Adeline Street to stock up on toiletries. I completed
checkout at 5:42 PM.

## 2025-02-22

On Saturday 2025-02-22, I briefly stopped at Walgreens in the late
afternoon to use the Allpoint ATM there and then checked whether the
Seventh Generation dish soap was in stock. It wasn't, so I went to
Berkeley Bowl and purchased some food as well as Seventh Generation
dish soap. The purchases are recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql).

## 2025-02-23

On Sunday 2025-02-23, in the late afternoon / early evening, I made
two trips to Sports Basement. In the first trip, I purchased a 20 lb
dumb bell and a 12 lb kettle bell. 20 lb was the only dumb bell size
above 10 lb, and I expect that it will be a good challenge weight for
biceps curls (it is too heavy for the more intense exercises I do with
weights up to 10 lb).

The 12 lb kettle bell felt like the right level of heavy for kettle
bell exercises (that I have not done previously). I also tried the 4
lb (it was too light and also its hole was too small for my use) and
30 lb and 35 lb (these were too heavy for the kinds of exercises I
plan to do, at least with my current strength level).

At time of checkout, I also purchased the lifetime membership for $25.

After dropping both weights at home, I made a second trip to purchase
a second 20 lb dumb bell.

In total, I saved $11 in discounts thanks to the lifetime membership
(this is before taxes, but so is the lifetime membership cost of $25).

## 2025-02-26

In the late afternoon / early evening, I made a trip to Walgreens to
stock up on toiletries. After I got back home and stowed away the
purchased stuff, I immediately headed out again for a trip to Whole
