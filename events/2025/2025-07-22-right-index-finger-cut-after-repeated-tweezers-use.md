# 2025-07-22: right index finger cut after repeated tweezers use

## Incident

On Tuesday 2025-07-22, around 4:30 PM, I repeatedly used 10-inch
tweezers (from [this
set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PV6F4MR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title))
for a house cleaning task (removing lint that was stuck in the dryer
lint screen area but not on the screen itself. I did this for about 5
to 10 minutes. As part of this process, I also removed the thing
holding the 12-inch tweezers, though I didn't end up using the 12-inch
tweezers. As I was wrapping up, I noticed that my right index finger
had a cut right around the point where I would have applied pressure
on the tweezers with it.

The blood washed out when I washed my hands with soap and water, but
reappeared within a minute, suggesting that the wound had not clotted
yet. In order to speed up the clotting process (and associated
healing) and also avoid the messiness coming from the bleeding finger,
I wrapped it in a water block flex bandage. The first bandage that I
attempted did not wrap properly, likely because of poor planning by me
around the angle (as the cut was slanted, I wrapped the bandage in a
way that aligned with it, but ended up with the two ends not meeting,
making the flex wrapping not work). I had more success with the second
bandage that I tried.

## Further updates

Shortly before midnight on the day of the cut (2025-07-22), so about 7
hours after the cut, the bandage came off during my bath. The area
covered by it had macerated, and the cut didn't get aggravated despite
water and soap being applied to it, so I decided not to put a new
bandage on it before going to sleep.

By the next morning (2025-07-23) when I woke up around 9 AM, the
maceration had reversed. As the cut seemed to be stable under finger
use and handwashing, I decided to not put on any bandage for the
morning at least as long as I was at home.

On 2025-07-23, I mostly proceeded as usual but did need to be a bit
careful when washing hands or using my hands to grip stuff. I skipped
the portions of hand gripper exercises that involved the use of the
right index finger.

By 2025-07-24, I was operating close to normally. I skipped all
exercises for other reasons, so I didn't have to make a decision
regarding hand gripper exercises.

On 2025-07-25, I was operating totally normally. I also did the usual
hand gripper exercises (including the right index finger) though I
made sure not to touch the hand gripper with that part of the finger.

## Best practices going forward

### Precautions at each tweezers use

I don't expect to need to use these tweezers often. Some of the
alternatives I might try in the future are:

* I can wear a glove on the hand using the tweezers. I don't know how
  well the glove shields from the sharpness of the tweezers.

* I can use a paper towel for intermediation, reducing the sharp
  pressure in a specific area.

* I can try to use multiple fingers for gripping (this can be combined
  with using the paper towel to spread the force). This will reduce
  the per-finger force needed, though it does increase the risk
  surface area. I can also switch around the relative pressure between
  the fingers over time so that no particular finger gets too
  stressed.

### Regular monitoring and pausing as soon as I notice issues

It would also be good practice to check the condition of my finger
after every few uses (let's say after a minute of use) and pause if I
see issues. I could go back, rest my fingers, apply vaseline, and
continue another day or at least after a few hours.

### Not doing this during times with a low risk tolerance

I should consider the use of such tweezers as risk-prone, so I should
avoid doing this at times with a low risk tolerance, such as right
before travel or right before an appointment.

### Vaseline application shortly prior

I've generally been regular with vaseline application; however, I did
not specifically apply vaseline in the run-up to the tweezers use, so
the last application was a few hours prior. Since this cut appears to
be purely a skin-level cut rather than something deeper, I suspect
that recent vaseline application may have helped.
