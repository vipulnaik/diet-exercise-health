# 2025-01-18: right little toe stub

## Incident

I woke up mid-sleep around 7:11 AM to urinate. After urination, I
walked over to drink water and apply vaseline. In the process, my
right leg moved erratically and the right little toe hit the chair
wheel. This "stub" led to a bit of bleeding so I put a flex bandage
around it. I got back in bed around 7:19 AM. The stub was painful for
about 15 minutes (estimted approximately by me; I didn't check the
time) and then got back to a normal level of sensation, where it
wasn't attracting my conscious attention.

I removed the waterproof flex bandage at around 1:30 AM (so about 18
hours later) toward the end of my shower/bath. There was a bit of red
swelling still present, but no active bleeding.

## Learnings

This incident comes on the heels (no pun intended) of a similar
incident a few days ago where my right second smallest toe hit the
chair, but that time there was no bleeding, likely because it's a
bigger toe and perhaps also because the speed at impact was
lower. However, I failed to learn from that experience, and this was
my comeuppance.

These are my current thoughts:

* When moving, I should aim to keep a margin of at least 2 inches on
  all sides between the rectangular hull of my feet and other objects,
  and when at rest or moving very slowly, at least 1
  inch. The "rectangular hull" aspect is important and in particular
  means that any impact to my toes will be felt by my biggest and
  strongest toes first.

* As an illustration of the above, let's say I want to stand in front
  of a sink and want to be close to it. When walking over to the sink,
  my feet should initially land to a point at least 2 inches in front
  of the base of the sink. I can then inch forward to reduce the gap
  to 1 inch, moving my feet slowly. The orientation should be
  forward-facing so that the biggest toes hit the base first if I
  miscalculate.

* I should pay close attention when "starting" movement from a
  1-inch-gap position, as may be the case when seated or when standing
  in front of a sink. It's best to start movement in a direction away
  from objects, and it may be wise to look toward the floor when
  unsure.

* I need to be particularly careful when:

  * barefoot (not wearing socks) as is the case in the morning for
    mid-sleep urination

  * sleepy as is the case for mid-sleep urination as this both
    increases the chances of jerky movements and means I am not that
    aware of my environment

  * cold because this both increases the chances of jerky movements
    and increases the damage from injury

My plan is to monitor my habits closely for a few days and then
hopefully revert to not thinking much about this, once I confirm that
I have incorporated these ideas.
