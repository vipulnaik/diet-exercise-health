# 2025-09-10: blood tests

See [here](2025-blood-test-plans-round-2.md) for details on what I am
getting tested as well as the booking process. This document is
focused on the actual blood draw and the preparatory and recovery
steps.

## Preparatory steps

### 2025-09-08 (two days prior): pausing of all supplements

On Monday 2025-09-08, I paused consumption of all supplements. So, my
last supplement consumption prior to the blood draw was on Sunday
2025-09-07.

### 2025-09-08 evening: weather check

On the evening of Monday 2025-09-08, I checked the weather forecast
and confirmed that it was fine for the blood draw.

### 2025-09-09 (one day prior): skipping of all exercises

On Tuesday 2025-09-09, I skipped all exercises in preparation for the
blood draw the next day.

### 2025-09-09 evening (evening prior): end to dinner

On the evening of Tuesday 2025-09-09, the evening prior to the blood
draw, I ended my dinner at 7:46 PM.

I had small amounts of residual food a little later: a little bit of
liquid mix (about half a teaspoon) at 9:05 PM and a single-digit
number of rice grains at around 9:15 PM.

### 2025-09-09 night: packing / prep

I did packing / prep at around 10:30 PM. This included packing the
requisition form (one signed copy and two unsigned copies) as well as
a black pen. I also streamlined some other elements so as to be able
to leave more quickly the next morning for the blood tests.
