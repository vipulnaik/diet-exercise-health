# 2025-04-01: use of perio toothbrush and baking soda toothpaste

On Tuesday 2025-04-01, as part of the periodic change of toothbrush, I
switched to a Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush. Unlike my usual toothbrush
that is just "soft" this is ultra-soft, with super-slim tapered
polyester bristles. My hope is that these will be better in terms of
reducing the risk of recession while also being good at cleaning
between the teeth. Though I didn't buy it from Amazon, you can see the
reviews on the [Amazon
page](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Collins-Perio-Toothbrush-colors/dp/B0036ZA40W/).

I also discarded my MaxFresh toothpaste that had reached expiration,
and opened an Arm & Hammer baking soda toothpaste. I didn't buy it
from Amazon, but you can see the [Amazon
page](https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Advance-Toothpaste-Technology/dp/B09VK1RKM8/). My
plan is to use this toothpaste about once a week to combat tooth
staining, while still keeping the frequency low enough that it doesn't
cause too much gum abrasion or worsen my recession. I am also
considering applying it only to the back teeth where the staining is
more common, but I am not sure how feasible that is to implement.
