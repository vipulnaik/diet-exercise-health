# 2025-09-29: amla purchase

On Monday 2025-09-29, I placed an order for amla, specifically
[Nutricost
Amla](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQ9Z728?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title). This
has 500 mg capsules, with a recommended serving size of 2 capsules per
day (1 gram per day).

The specific motivation was the claimed beneficial effects of amla on
LDL cholesterol levels. It also seems to be generally beneficial for
health.

I picked it up as part of an Amazon Hub Locker package pickup trip on
Friday 2025-10-03.

My initial rollout plan is to start at 1 capsule a day (500 mg) for at
least 1 week and then decide whether to go up to 2 capsules a day.
