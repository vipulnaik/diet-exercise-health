# 2025-09-29: amla purchase

## Start

On Monday 2025-09-29, I placed an order for amla, specifically
[Nutricost
Amla](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GQ9Z728?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title). This
has 500 mg capsules, with a recommended serving size of 2 capsules per
day (1 gram per day).

The specific motivation was the claimed beneficial effects of amla on
LDL cholesterol levels. It also seems to be generally beneficial for
health.

I picked it up as part of an Amazon Hub Locker package pickup trip on
Friday 2025-10-03.

My initial rollout plan is to start at 1 capsule a day (500 mg) for at
least 1 week and then decide whether to go up to 2 capsules a day.

## Pause on 2025-10-09

On Thursday 2025-10-09, I decided to pause the amla consumption.

The main reason for pause was general soreness in the abdominal area
and other symptoms. Some of these might be connected to the
[2025-10-02 health issues](2025-10-02-health-issues.md) that happened
before I started amla. However, there are some indications that the
amla consumption is related -- I get more amla burps and a general
feeling of rejection of the amla capsules.

## Resumption on 2025-10-24 with a different protocol

I'm resuming amla on Friday 2025-10-24 with a somewhat different
protocol (I had initially planned to resume on Thursday 2025-10-23,
but I skipped strength exercises and therefore missed the cue).

Instead of having a single capsule of amla with the first meal, my
plan is to have two capsules of amla as follows:

* 1 capsule of amla right after I finish exercise, which should
  generally be about 60 to 90 minutes before I start my meal. I also
  plan to make a point of drinking a lot of water along with the amla
  capsule, so as to encourage it to get absorbed quickly and not
  linger in the GI tract, thereby reducing the potential GI
  side-effects.

* Another capsule of amla right after brushing teeth between my two
  meals, again with a large amount of water, that also serves as my
  pre-meal water. This brushing generally happens within about an hour
  prior to my second meal, and it's often about 10 minutes before the
  meal.

If I find that two capsules of amla produce too much by way of GI
discomfort, I will maintain the morning dose but stop the evening
dose.
