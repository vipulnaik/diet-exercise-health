# 2025-12-22: reduced hearing in left ear

I had reduced hearing in my left ear in the morning and early
afternoon on 2025-12-22, but it resolved by around 8:10 PM (as judged
subjectively by headphone balance), and I verified the resolution
using minimum audible volume and balance tests at around 11:40 PM.

ear](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md).

## Background

I've been doing minimum audible volume tests and balance tests
regularly with normal headphones and bone conduction headphones. I
also executed the [hearing
checklist](../../logs/hearing-checklist-log.md) on 2025-12-19, though
this execution was focused on speech-in-noise.

I passed minimum audible volume and balance tests with no issues with
normal headphones on 2025-12-10 and with bone conduction headphones on
2025-12-14.

On 2025-12-18, I passed the minimum audible volume test but detected a
slight difference between the ears when doing the balance test, with
sound slightly louder in the right ear. I attributed this to left ear
compression when sleeping.

On 2025-12-20, I passed both minimum audible volume and balance tests
with bone conduction headphones with no issues.

## Beginning of issues on 2025-12-22

### Balance issues detected in normal use in a meeting

When I joined in a work meeting, I noticed that the sound was skewed
to the right. I also felt heavier in my left ear, suggesting earwax
buildup; the experience was very similar to the situation last
year. Sounds in the left ear were somewhat muffled.

Over the next couple of hours, I did the minimum audible volume test
and balance test using the [standard Love Me Like You Do YouTube
track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo) using both normal
headphones and bone conduction headphones. Here's what I observed:

* My right ear continued to pass all tests.

* With normal headphones, my left ear was not able to detect any sound
  at 1/64 at 50% YouTube volume. It was able to detect some sound at
  1/64 at 100% YouTube volume, but not able to clearly make out the
  words. Only at 4/64 (1/16) was I able to clearly make out words with
  my left ear.

* The loudness gap between the ears with normal headphones was about
  3/64 points. So for instance 8/64 on the left ear was approximately
  the same as 5/64 on the right ear.

* With bone conduction headphones, my left ear was not able to detect
  sound at 1/16 (the minimum the headphones can go) at 50% YouTube
  volume, but was able to detect sound at 1/16 at 100% YouTube
  volume. I was not able to make the words out as clearly as I could
  with the right ear.

* The loudness gap between the ears with bone conduction headphones
  was about 1/16 (I can't go finer than that, so the actual gap may be
  3/64 or 5/64).

### Preliminary diagnosis of earwax (cerumen impaction)

There were several similarities with [last time's
experience](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md):

* I had reduced hearing in my left ear relative to my right ear, and
  the loss translated to a gap in how many units of volume I needed to
  adjust to achieve parity.

* The reduced hearing was experienced when I woke up, likely related
  to compression when sleeping on the left side, and accompanied by a
  more muffled/heavy/compresesd feeling in my left ear.

* The gap was more significant with normal headphones than with bone
  conduction headphones.

I was better prepared than last time:

* I had a better understanding of how hearing works, and in particular
  of how to measure and quantify my hearing quickly.

* I had been taking regular measurements, so I had more confidence
  that the problem had started recently.

* I had a better sense of a path that was likely to resolve the issue.

### Further research

I initially looked into options related to digital otoscopes; I looked
through a few products and read their reviews and watched product
demonstration videos. I looked at [this
product](https://www.amazon.com/AnyScope-Digital-Otoscope-Compatible-Android/dp/B0DT5RMVXK/)
and [this successor
product](https://www.amazon.com/AnyScope-Digital-Otoscope-Gyroscope-Compatible-dp-B0DT5TRG9V/dp/B0DT5TRG9V/).

I did some research by watching videos; this included re-watching
videos from last time. The goal was to evaluate if I should be trying
other remedies before booking an earwax removal appointment with the
audiologist like I had done last time.

  Disorders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vWvoZKhpnY) (new) (I
  watched the initial portions discussing cerumen impaction (cerumen
  is the technical term for earwax) and otitis externa; I might watch
  the rest later.

After watching the videos and thinking through the contents, I made
the following decisions:

* I decided to purchase the digital otoscope anyway, but only for use
  as a camera and not for earwax removal.

* I will review the results of the otoscope and use that to inform my
  strategy on at-home earwax removal using ear drops.

## Resolution of issues on 2025-12-22 (same day as beginning of issues)

At 8:10 PM, I put headphones on to listen to stuff during meal
prep. The headphones felt balanced. I didn't do a minimum audible
volume test at this time because I wanted to focus on meal prep
first. I wasn't sure whether the balance is because hearing is
restored in my left ear or due to neurological compensation.

At 11:40 PM, after completing meal prep, eating, and putting food in
the fridge, I redid my standard tests using normal headphones: the
minimum audible volume and balance tests. The minimum audible volume
test passed in both ears and the balance test also passed. This
confirms resolution of the issue.

However, I suspect that there's enough earwax buildup that I am at
risk for recurrence, so I plan to continue investigation, including
using the otoscope to gauge the extent of earwax and then potentially
trying out ear drops or scheduling an appointment with the audiologist
for earwax removal.

## Recurrence of reduced hearing in left ear on 2025-12-23 in the morning

I redid the minimum audible volume and balance tests with normal
headphones in the morning on Tuesday 2025-12-23. I reproduced similar
results as seen on 2025-12-22 in the morning. The only difference was
that I estimated the balance gap as 4/64 instead of 3/64, but this is
mostly a judgment call and may not reflect a difference in the real
balance gap.

When I tested again at 4:30 PM, hearing in the left ear had improved
somewhat but the gap had not completely disappeared. I was now able to
hear words clearly at 1/64 at 100% YouTube volume but not at 50%
YouTube volume. I estimated a net gap between the ears of about 2/64
(1/64 for the right ear roughly matched 3/64 for the left ear).
