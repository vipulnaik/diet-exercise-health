# 2025-12-22: reduced hearing in left ear

See also: [2024-11-29: reduced hearing in left
ear](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md).

## Background

I've been doing minimum audible volume tests and balance tests
regularly with normal headphones and bone conduction headphones. I
also executed the [hearing
checklist](../../logs/hearing-checklist-log.md) on 2025-12-19, though
this execution was focused on speech-in-noise.

I passed minimum audible volume and balance tests with no issues with
normal headphones on 2025-12-10 and with bone conduction headphones on
2025-12-14.

On 2025-12-18, I passed the minimum audible volume test but detected a
slight difference between the ears when doing the balance test, with
sound slightly louder in the right ear. I attributed this to left ear
compression when sleeping.

On 2025-12-20, I passed both minimum audible volume and balance tests
with bone conduction headphones with no issues.

## Beginning of issues on 2025-12-22

### Balance issues detected in normal use in a meeting

When I joined in a work meeting, I noticed that the sound was skewed
to the right. I also felt heavier in my left ear, suggesting earwax
buildup; the experience was very similar to the situation last
year. Sounds in the left ear were somewhat muffled.

Over the next couple of hours, I did the minimum audible volume test
and balance test using the [standard Love Me Like You Do YouTube
track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo) using both normal
headphones and bone conduction headphones. Here's what I observed:

* My right ear continued to pass all tests.

* With normal headphones, my left ear was not able to detect any sound
  at 1/64 at 50% YouTube volume. It was able to detect some sound at
  1/64 at 100% YouTube volume, but not able to clearly make out the
  words. Only at 4/64 (1/16) was I able to clearly make out words with
  my left ear.

* The loudness gap between the ears with normal headphones was about
  3/64 points. So for instance 8/64 on the left ear was approximately
  the same as 5/64 on the right ear.

* With bone conduction headphones, my left ear was not able to detect
  sound at 1/16 (the minimum the headphones can go) at 50% YouTube
  volume, but was able to detect sound at 1/16 at 100% YouTube
  volume. I was not able to make the words out as clearly as I could
  with the right ear.

* The loudness gap between the ears with bone conduction headphones
  was about 1/16 (I can't go finer than that, so the actual gap may be
  3/64 or 5/64).

### Preliminary diagnosis of earwax (cerumen impaction)

There were several similarities with [last time's
experience](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md):

* I had reduced hearing in my left ear relative to my right ear, and
  the loss translated to a gap in how many units of volume I needed to
  adjust to achieve parity.

* The reduced hearing was experienced when I woke up, likely related
  to compression when sleeping on the left side, and accompanied by a
  more muffled/heavy/compresesd feeling in my left ear.

* The gap was more significant with normal headphones than with bone
  conduction headphones.

I was better prepared than last time:

* I had a better understanding of how hearing works, and in particular
  of how to measure and quantify my hearing quickly.

* I had been taking regular measurements, so I had more confidence
  that the problem had started recently.

* I had a better sense of a path that was likely to resolve the issue.

### Further research

I initially looked into options related to digital otoscopes; I looked
through a few products and read their reviews and watched product
demonstration videos. I looked at [this
product](https://www.amazon.com/AnyScope-Digital-Otoscope-Compatible-Android/dp/B0DT5RMVXK/)
and [this successor
product](https://www.amazon.com/AnyScope-Digital-Otoscope-Gyroscope-Compatible-dp-B0DT5TRG9V/dp/B0DT5TRG9V/).

I did some research by watching videos; this included re-watching
videos from last time. The goal was to evaluate if I should be trying
other remedies before booking an earwax removal appointment with the
audiologist like I had done last time.

* [Intro to Clinical Medicine: Ear
  Disorders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vWvoZKhpnY) (new) (I
  watched the initial portions discussing cerumen impaction (cerumen
  is the technical term for earwax) and otitis externa; I might watch
  the rest later.

  had been looking at otoscopes)

As of the afternoon on 2025-12-22, here is where I currently stand:

* I am uncertain about whether to try earwax removal. I'm still pondering it.

* I am pretty sure I do not want to use the earwax removal tools with
  the otoscope, but I am undecided on whether it's worth trying the
  otoscope for the camera feature to get more insight into what's
  happening with earwax.
