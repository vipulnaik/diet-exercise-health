# 2025-12-22: reduced hearing in left ear

I had reduced hearing in my left ear in the morning and early
afternoon on 2025-12-22, but it resolved by around 8:10 PM (as judged
subjectively by headphone balance), and I verified the resolution
using minimum audible volume and balance tests at around 11:40 PM.

See also: [2024-11-29: reduced hearing in left
ear](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md).

## Background

I've been doing minimum audible volume tests and balance tests
regularly with normal headphones and bone conduction headphones. I
also executed the [hearing
checklist](../../logs/hearing-checklist-log.md) on 2025-12-19, though
this execution was focused on speech-in-noise.

I passed minimum audible volume and balance tests with no issues with
normal headphones on 2025-12-10 and with bone conduction headphones on
2025-12-14.

On 2025-12-18, I passed the minimum audible volume test but detected a
slight difference between the ears when doing the balance test, with
sound slightly louder in the right ear. I attributed this to left ear
compression when sleeping.

On 2025-12-20, I passed both minimum audible volume and balance tests
with bone conduction headphones with no issues.

## Beginning of issues on 2025-12-22

### Balance issues detected in normal use in a meeting

When I joined in a work meeting, I noticed that the sound was skewed
to the right. I also felt heavier in my left ear, suggesting earwax
buildup; the experience was very similar to the situation last
year. Sounds in the left ear were somewhat muffled.

Over the next couple of hours, I did the minimum audible volume test
and balance test using the [standard Love Me Like You Do YouTube
track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo) using both normal
headphones and bone conduction headphones. Here's what I observed:

* My right ear continued to pass all tests.

* With normal headphones, my left ear was not able to detect any sound
  at 1/64 at 50% YouTube volume. It was able to detect some sound at
  1/64 at 100% YouTube volume, but not able to clearly make out the
  words. Only at 4/64 (1/16) was I able to clearly make out words with
  my left ear.

* The loudness gap between the ears with normal headphones was about
  3/64 points. So for instance 8/64 on the left ear was approximately
  the same as 5/64 on the right ear.

* With bone conduction headphones, my left ear was not able to detect
  sound at 1/16 (the minimum the headphones can go) at 50% YouTube
  volume, but was able to detect sound at 1/16 at 100% YouTube
  volume. I was not able to make the words out as clearly as I could
  with the right ear.

* The loudness gap between the ears with bone conduction headphones
  was about 1/16 (I can't go finer than that, so the actual gap may be
  3/64 or 5/64).

### Preliminary diagnosis of earwax (cerumen impaction)

There were several similarities with [last time's
experience](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md):

* I had reduced hearing in my left ear relative to my right ear, and
  the loss translated to a gap in how many units of volume I needed to
  adjust to achieve parity.

* The reduced hearing was experienced when I woke up, likely related
  to compression when sleeping on the left side, and accompanied by a
  more muffled/heavy/compresesd feeling in my left ear.

* The gap was more significant with normal headphones than with bone
  conduction headphones.

I was better prepared than last time:

* I had a better understanding of how hearing works, and in particular
  of how to measure and quantify my hearing quickly.

* I had been taking regular measurements, so I had more confidence
  that the problem had started recently.

* I had a better sense of a path that was likely to resolve the issue.

### Further research

I initially looked into options related to digital otoscopes; I looked
through a few products and read their reviews and watched product
demonstration videos. I looked at [this
product](https://www.amazon.com/AnyScope-Digital-Otoscope-Compatible-Android/dp/B0DT5RMVXK/)
and [this successor
product](https://www.amazon.com/AnyScope-Digital-Otoscope-Gyroscope-Compatible-dp-B0DT5TRG9V/dp/B0DT5TRG9V/).

I did some research by watching videos; this included re-watching
videos from last time. The goal was to evaluate if I should be trying
other remedies before booking an earwax removal appointment with the
audiologist like I had done last time.

* [Intro to Clinical Medicine: Ear
  Disorders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vWvoZKhpnY) (new) (I
  watched the initial portions discussing cerumen impaction (cerumen
  is the technical term for earwax) and otitis externa; I might watch
  the rest later.

After watching the videos and thinking through the contents, I made
the following decisions:

* I decided to purchase the digital otoscope anyway, but only for use
  as a camera and not for earwax removal.

* I will review the results of the otoscope and use that to inform my
  strategy on at-home earwax removal using ear drops.

## Resolution of issues on 2025-12-22 (same day as beginning of issues)

At 8:10 PM, I put headphones on to listen to stuff during meal
prep. The headphones felt balanced. I didn't do a minimum audible
volume test at this time because I wanted to focus on meal prep
first. I wasn't sure whether the balance is because hearing is
restored in my left ear or due to neurological compensation.

At 11:40 PM, after completing meal prep, eating, and putting food in
the fridge, I redid my standard tests using normal headphones: the
minimum audible volume and balance tests. The minimum audible volume
test passed in both ears and the balance test also passed. This
confirms resolution of the issue.

However, I suspect that there's enough earwax buildup that I am at
risk for recurrence, so I plan to continue investigation, including
using the otoscope to gauge the extent of earwax and then potentially
trying out ear drops or scheduling an appointment with the audiologist
for earwax removal.

## Recurrence of reduced hearing in left ear on 2025-12-23 in the morning

I redid the minimum audible volume and balance tests with normal
headphones in the morning on Tuesday 2025-12-23. I reproduced similar
results as seen on 2025-12-22 in the morning. The only difference was
that I estimated the balance gap as 4/64 instead of 3/64, but this is
mostly a judgment call and may not reflect a difference in the real
balance gap.

When I tested again at 4:30 PM, hearing in the left ear had improved
somewhat but the gap had not completely disappeared. I was now able to
hear words clearly at 1/64 at 100% YouTube volume but not at 50%
YouTube volume. I estimated a net gap between the ears of about 2/64
(1/64 for the right ear roughly matched 3/64 for the left ear).

When I tested again at around 6:45 PM, hearing in the left ear was
back to normal. I passed both the minimum audible volume and balance
tests with normal headphones, though maybe there was still a slight
difference between the ears on the order of 1/64 (within my margin of
error).

## Recurrence again on 2025-12-25 and use of digital otoscope (for photos) and Ear Wax MD (for earwax removal)

### Recurrence and return to normal

On 2025-12-25, at around 5:30 PM, I detected minimum audible volume
and balance issues again (with both normal headphones and bone
conduction headphones), with an estimated gap of 4 to 6 out of 64, and
other symptoms fairly similar to earlier. I did this testing before
the digital otoscope use described below, so it was not affected by
any aggravation caused by the otoscope.

When I tested again at around 11:10 PM with normal headphones, the
minimum audible volume test passed for both ears. The balance test
also passed (sound was equally loud in both ears).

### Use of digital otoscope

I used the digital otoscope (that I had picked up the previous day,
2025-12-24) with the black silicone cap on but was not able to orient
it in a way that yielded clear pictures of the inner portion of my ear
canal. I went as far as I could comfortably go. I did take pictures
and saved them to Google Drive. The pictures identified a yellow
earwax spot in the outer portion of the left ear, that I was able to
mostly remove with my finger.

A few other notes:

* Initially, I was having trouble because hair from my head and
  sideburns kept interfering with the otoscope images (this was more
  of an issue when self-administering, because it was hard to get an
  accurate sense of direction when doing the manipulations). I
  ultimately shaved off my sideburns and slightly trimmed my head hair
  and was then able to use the otoscope without interference.

* The process of using the otoscope may have exacerbated some of my
  left ear irritation that peaked shortly after I finished otoscope
  use, but it subsided within about an hour. The otoscope use did not
  affect the results of my minimum audible volume and balance tests; I
  got similar results on the tests I did shortly after otoscope use as
  I had gotten at around 5:30 PM before starting otoscope use.

### Earwax removal: review of last year's effort in preparation for trying again this year

NOTE: For the most up-to-date guidance related to at-home earwax removal, see
[best practices around at-home earwax
removal](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-at-home-earwax-removal.md).

Last year, on 2024-12-24 going into 2025-12-25 (so one year and one
day ago!) I had tried applying Ear Wax MD for earwax removal, as
documented in [last year's
document](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md#research-on-and-efforts-toward-earwax-removal-on-2024-12-24). At the time, it had not
appeared to work, but I also lacked some of the more sophisticated
measurement approaches last time, and the hearing reduction had been
much more severe, so it may be that a single application didn't work
last time. So my plan is to try again on the night of 2025-12-25,
mostly following a similar protocol.

In addition to reading through last time's notes, I watched the
[how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zvzYmQMzfHo) linked from
the [Eosera how-to page](https://www.eosera.com/pages/how-to-use).

#### Protocol

My plan is as follows:

* Prep by placing hand towels on top of my pillow so that I lie down
  on these, so that any earwax discharge lands on the hand towels

* Prep by separating the earwax tube I intend to apply from the rest

* Prep by having the earwax removal syringe kit handy

* Lie down on my *right* side (so that I can apply the earwax in my
  left ear) with the phone in my hand

* Start the phone timer

* Begin application of the Ear Wax MD from the tube, squeezing the
  entirety of the tube contents over a few minutes

* Lay still for 20 to 30 minutes from the start of application,
  assuming the stuff does not get on my hands or in my eyes, and does
  not get on a lot of skin to the point that it causes itching or
  burning

* After being done, wipe my ears with the hand towels, then use the
  earwax removal syringe kit with warm water (neither hot nor cold,
  ideally around body temperature) a few times in my ear

* Dry out the ears, then go for my bath where I make sure to wash out
  my ear using warm water

#### Evaluation of success

For the application last year (2024) I evaluated using the minimum
audible volume test as well as frequency hearing tests that I had done
a few times before application, and did immediately after and a few
more times after application. I did not see any change in these
results. I started balance tests only after application, so I don't
have a before/after of those.

The situation this time is somewhat different from last time. First,
the magnitude of hearing loss seems less significant than last
time. Second, it has shown a tendency to reverse itself over the
course of the day on two past days (2025-12-22 and 2025-12-23), which
was not the case last time, where the issue persisted for about 1.5
months until it was fixed by earwax removal.

So, this time, I'll use a more nuanced and multifaceted measure of
success.

* I will evaluate subjective heaviness / muffled sensations in the
  left ear (that correlates with reduced hearing on the whole, but is
  easier to sense without running a test).

* I will evaluate not just whether the reduced hearing resolves on its
  own, but also the pattern of how it ebbs and flows within the day
  for the next week or so.

#### Notes written last time before the application, with a few additional annottations

* If there are different strengths and formulations, the difference
  between them: I watched some of the videos above to compare
  different formulations. Sodium bicarbonate is among the more
  effective, but may be unwise to apply frequently. The hope is that I
  make significant progress with the first application.

* Expected dose range: My plan is to limit myself to a single tube,
  and squeeze as much of it as I need to till my left ear feels full.

* Frequency range: I'm currently only planning to do this once to
  begin with, and at most one more time within the next week. I will
  re-evaluate after that. ANNOTATION: See previous subsection for how
  I am evaluating.

* Minimum and maximum dose gap: Minimum gap of 1 day. No maximum gap.

* Impact of missing a dose -- is it advisable to double-dose, or just
  contine with other doses regularly? Don't double-dose.

* Any dependence or tolerance effects that are known: I'm not yet
  planning to do this often enough for such effects to become a
  concern.

Timing information: Based on the how-to, this is most convenient to do
before a bath so that I can wash the ear out properly.

Risk of getting in eyes: My plan is to keep my eyes closed during the
squeezing process, and for most of the 20 minutes waiting time after
that (ANNOTATION: last time I ended up waiting 30 minutes from the
start of application instead of 20, and I'm hoping and planning to do
the same this time if nothing goes wrong). If for whatever reason
something does get in my eyes, it looks like the priority will be to
flush the eyes for a lengthy period of time, and forgo the earwax
removal benefits for this time.

Risk of getting on hands: The tube structure means that there
shouldn't be stuff getting on hands. Even so, I'll keep towels
handy to wipe my hands, and if a lot gets on hands I may again have to
abandon the earwax removal plan and focus on washing my hands first.

Other parts of the skin: My plan is to wipe off minor amounts that get
on the skin, but if a lot gets on and it's itching and burning, then
cleaning it up takes priority over earwax removal.

### Actual process of application of Ear Wax MD

NOTE: For the most up-to-date guidance related to at-home earwax
removal, see [best practices around at-home earwax
removal](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-at-home-earwax-removal.md).

I finished closing my laptop and brushing my teeth by around 11:40 PM,
and from that point onward I began the preparatory work as planned in
the protocol described above.

I made a few additions:

* I washed my feet; normally, I get into bed after a bath so my feet
  are washed, but in this case I was doing it before my bath, so I
  made a point of washing my feet.

* I removed my sweatshirt before getting in.

* I kept my scrunchy on, which is different from when I go to bed to
  sleep. This was to reduce the risk of hair falling over the left ear
  while I was trying to apply the Ear Wax MD.

* I kept a paper towel on the somewhat dirty window sill so that I
  could put stuff there if needed.

* I needed some level of lighting, but not too much, so instead of
  putting my bedroom light on I put on another light that was a little
  farther out.

* I made sure my trash can is accessible from my bed so I could throw
  out the tube once I finished it without getting out of position.

* I put my socks in the laundry and took out a fresh pair of socks to
  use after the ear drop application.

Here is the timeline of the process:

* 11:40 PM: I finished brushing teeth and started preparing per the
  protocol.

* 11:49 PM: I removed my sweatshirt.

* 11:55 PM: I started my phone timer and began applying Ear Wax MD in
  small increments. I kept the tube above my ear throughout. I
  squeezed for a couple of seconds, then paused for a few seconds to
  let it enter.

* 11:59 PM: After four minutes of application, I paused application
  for about a minute. At this time, I rotated the tube to point up,
  moved it away from my ear, and capped in. This was because my ear
  felt like it was full of the fluid.

* 12:00 AM: I resumed application of Ear Wax MD.

* 12:02 AM: I finished the Ear Wax MD tube and threw it in the trash.

* 12:03 AM to 12:12 AM: Over this period, I gently wiped off the
  earwax and fluid from my left ear, while staying in position, using
  the hand towel I was sleeping on. Over the middle of the period, I
  got the most wax out, with yellow and brown colors (and a bit of
  red, which might indicate some inflammation). By the end, I was not
  getting any wax out.

* 12:18 AM: By this point, I no longer felt fluid in my ear but it
  still felt a little heavy/itchy.

* 12:25 AM: Around this time, I got out of bed, about 30 minutes after
  I had started the timer.

* 12:33 AM to 12:40 AM: This is around the time that I started the
  irrigation process using the Walgreens earwax removal kit (syringe
  and bulb). It took me a few attempts to get the right temperature
  setting (it's about halfway from neutral to hot). After about 5 to
  10 rounds of irrigation, I washed the syringe and bulb with soap and
  water and left them to dry. I did not notice any additional earwax
  coming out at this stage.

* 12:40 AM to 12:45 AM: I took photos of the hand towel with the
  earwax on it, then washed off the earwax with soap and water, then
  put the hand towel in the laundry for a fuller wash. Unfortunately,
  I got the idea of taking photos only after I had already washed one
  of three regions on the towel with earwax, so I could only get
  photos of the other two regions.

* 12:49 AM: Around this time, I did the minimum audible volume and
  balance tests with normal headphones. The former passed for both
  ears and the latter also passed; this was the same result as I had
  gotten for the equivalent tests I did around 11:10 PM (shortly
  before the ear drop application).

## Continued monitoring of reduced hearing issues over the next few days and second application of earwax on 2026-01-04 (overnight from 2026-01-03)

### Minimum audible volume and balance test results over the interim period

I continued to do minimum audible volume and balance tests with normal
headphones over the next few days.

* 2025-12-26 afternoon: gap of about 4/64, with minimum audible volume
  in left ear 1/64 at 100% YouTube volume; could only hear muffled
  sounds at 1/64 at 50% YouTube volume

* 2025-12-27 night: similar result as on 2025-12-26 afternoon

* 2025-12-28 night: similar result as on 2025-12-26 afternoon

* 2025-12-30 night: similar result as on 2025-12-26 afternoon

* 2026-01-03 afternoon/evening: gap down to 2/64, with minimum audible
  volume in left ear 1/64 at about 50% YouTube volume, compared to
  about 25-30% YouTube volume for right ear

* 2026-01-04 just past midnight from 2026-01-03: similar result as on
  2026-01-03 afternoon

A few observations:

* The data as recorded suggests stagnation for a few days after the
  ear drop application and then a sudden improvement. But the 4/64 versus
  3/64 versus 2/64 difference is not very precise, and it's possible
  that the 2025-12-30 result was already down to a 3/64 gap but I
  subjectively assessed it as 4/64.

* Prior to ear drop application, I had a phenomenon where the gap
  would be more early in the morning and resolve itself by the
  evening. However, after ear drop application, the gap doesn't seem
  to have that sort of intra-day variation. It isn't clear if the ear
  drop application played a causal role here.

### Speculation

I have anecdotally noticed a bit more earwax coming out of my left ear
over the past week, so one possibility is that in addition to the
earwax that came out immediately as a result of the ear drop
application, it softened the earwax and made more come out. This might
be driving the improvement in hearing over time.

The end to intra-day variation is puzzling, but it might reflect some
movement of the earwax as a result of the ear drop application, which
changed the microgeography in a way that's less amenable to intra-day
variation.

### Thinking behind seeking a second round of ear drop application in the left ear

My hope with the second round of ear drop application is to get more
clarity to help determine the priority of making an appointment for
earwax removal. Some of the things I hope to learn are:

* Does a similar quantity of earwax come out as before, or is it less?
  This will give me a better sense of the time series of removed
  earwax volume with a function of iteration count. If it's pretty
  similar to last time, then the model is something like "layers of
  earwax" with each round of ear drop application successfully
  removing the outer layer. On the other hand, if very little comes
  out this time, the model is more like "easy-to-remove versus
  hard-to-remove earwax" where the easy-to-remove earwax comes off
  with the ear drops whereas the hard-to-remove earwax needs the use
  of earwax removal tools by an audiologist.

* How is the hearing in my left ear affected? I expect that if not
  much earwax comes out, it's very unlikely (though still possible)
  that the hearing in my left ear will improve immediately, and if it
  improves gradually, I would not attribute it to the second round of
  ear drop application. On the other hand, if a decent amount of
  earwax comes out, comparable with the first time, it will be
  interesting to see how it affects my hearing. If the hearing in my
  left ear improves immediately or over the coming week, I will
  attribute it as a likely consequence of ear drop application.

I chose to wait nine days after the first application, for two
reasons. First, given the alkaline nature of the ear drops, it is
recommended to not apply them more often than once a week in any given
ear. Second, I wanted to wait a week to see if the problem resolves
itself.

### Application of Ear Wax MD ear drops

#### High-level comments

I adhered closely to the [best practices around at-home earwax
removal](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-at-home-earwax-removal.md)
that I had designed and refined based on last time's experience. While
I followed the procedure closely this time, some aspects of the
experience turned out to be different.

* I was able to empty the tube into my ear much faster. The last time,
  I had taken about 7 minutes total, whereas this time I took 4
  minutes total. I was able to go faster because the ear drops did not
  irritate me as much and did not lead to as much feeling of
  fullness. I don't know how much is just me getting used to the ear
  drops versus changes to the level of earwax affecting my sensations.

* The wiping of earwax while lying down started a little later (13
  minutes after start of application versus 8 minutes after start of
  application last time) but the process also lasted longer (13
  minutes versus 9 minutes) and the overall quantity of earwax that
  came out this way was more than last time.

* I removed significant amounts of earwax after irrigation. For
  comparison, last time, I did not remove any noticeable amounts of
  earwax after irrigation; all the earwax had come out after lying
  down. This time, the amount of earwax removed after irrigation was
  similar to the amount of earwax removed while lying down, though in
  fewer but larger chunks. I don't know how much of this is a result
  of more effective irrigation (since this time I had more practice
  with the irrigation process including the temperature setting) and
  how much is due to changes to the earwax microgeography of the ear.

* Toward the end of the earwax removal after irrigation, I had a
  sudden sensation of unblocking of my left ear. When I did the
  minimum audible volume and balance tests shortly after, the hearing
  in my left ear had returned to normal, and maybe it was even a
  little better than the right ear.

#### Timeline

This is the timeline of application:

* 12:57 AM: I finished brushing my teeth and started preparation for
  the ear drop application.

* 1:01 AM: I removed my sweatshirt.

* 1:12 AM: I started the phone timer to begin ear drop application
  lying down in bed.

* 1:16 AM: I had finished squeezing the tube and thrown the empty tube
  into the trash.

* 1:25 AM: Around this time, I started wiping earwax off of my left
  ear onto the towels, while still lying down.

* 1:38 AM: By this time, I was no longer getting earwax while wiping
  my ear while lying down.

* 1:43 AM: Around this time, I got out of bed.

* 1:55 AM: By this time, I had completed irrigation and a second round
  of earwax removal post-irrigation (for which I used the second
  towel). Significant amounts of earwax came out in this second round.

* 2 AM: I completed minimum audible volume and balance tests using
  normal headphones, passing in both ears.

* 2:05 AM to 2:25 AM: Around this time, I took photographs of the
  earwax on the towels and uploaded them to Google Drive. I also made
  a few quick notes that I could use to document the next day.

* 2:35 AM to 2:41 AM: I used dish soap to get the earwax stains out of
  the towels and then left them to air dry (once they are dry I will
  put them in the laundry load for a proper wash).

### Re-run of minimum audible volume and balance tests the next morning

At around 11:20 AM the next morning (2026-01-04), shortly after waking
up, I did minimum audible volume and balance tests again. The hearing
in my left ear was reduced again, with a gap of about 4/64 between the
ears. This mirrored a sense of compression of the left ear that I
experienced in the morning while sleeping on my left side.

### Overall take and planned next steps as of 2026-01-04 early afternoon

Since more earwax came out in the second round than the first, this is
suggestive of a "layers" model where the first round only removed the
outer layer of earwax, and the second round removed a further
layer.

The fact that the hearing improved immediately but then regressed
again the next morning suggests that there may be more layers, and I'm
fighting an active process of continued buildup of earwax (and
potentially other factors not directly related to earwax that combine
with it to cause reduced hearing).

In light of these, my plan is as follows:

* Add to my stock of Ear Wax MD. I now have only two tubes left. Given
  the success so far but also that there appears to be a need for more
  application, I should have a larger stock. I'll try to get more from
  Walgreens in the coming week, but if they don't have it in stock, I
  will order from Amazon.

* Continue monitoring my hearing for another week.

* Consider doing another round of application in my left ear after
  waiting at least one week and not more than three weeks.

* After this third round of application, based on the amount of earwax
  that comes out as well as how my hearing progresses before and
  after, make a decision regarding whether to seek professional earwax
  removal (with an audiologist) or identify a cadence for continued
  ear drop application. Also, consider whether to use ear drops in my
  right ear as well prior to a professional appointment, which might
  give me valuable information on the comparative earwax status of the
  ears before the professional earwax removal clears out the impacted
  earwax entirely.

  My current thinking is that the steady-state cadence should not be
  more than once every 2 months per ear, and this third application is
  the last application that is more frequent than the steady-state
