## 2025-01-01: at-home jogging

I did at-home jogging on 2025-01-01. The rest of my exercise proceeded
normally.

## 2025-01-02: skipped exercise due to call with work colleagues

I skipped all exercise due to a call with work colleagues that used up
the time I would normally exercise.

## 2025-01-03 and 2025-01-04: at-home jogging

I did at-home jogging on 2025-01-03 and 2025-01-04. The rest of my
exercise proceeded normally. On both days, this was due to it being
quite cold and my desire to finish jogging soon rather than wait till
later in the day when it would be slightly warmer.

On 2025-01-05, I returned to jogging outside.

## 2025-01-06: abridged at-home jogging and skipped dead hang / pull-ups

On Monday 2025-01-06, I did abridged at-home jogging primarily due to
time constraints (about half the usual length). I also skipped dead
hang and pull-ups, also due to time constraints.

## 2025-01-09: skipping all exercise due to general fatigue plus timing constraints

On 2025-01-09, I skipped exercise due to a mix of general fatigue and
timing constraints. I had stayed up late the previous day, got to bed
late, woke up late, and had a somewhat busy morning. I didn't want to
delay eating too much and I wanted to reset to an earlier time, and
going out to exercise would have delayed things quite a bit.

I was also generally fatigued from the past few hectic days, and also
slightly underslept, and felt that skipping exercise would help me
recover more quickly.

I also have a lot of work to do, and skipping exercise could save me
valuable time and help me get more on top of things.

## 2025-01-12: skipping all exercise due to time crunch for the day (due to sleep time adjustment needed)

Primarily due to a large cyclic personal chores load, I went to sleep
late on 2025-01-11 (around 3 AM), and correspondingly got up late on
the morning of 2025-01-12 (around 11 AM). This would not normally be a
problem, but I need to be up by 9 AM on 2025-01-13 to be ready for
work meetings, which means I effectively have 2 hours less for
2025-01-12. Skipping exercise is the prudent course to achieve this
(because exercise not only directly costs time but also imposes an
additional 1-hour delay on the meal start time).

This might also be generally helpful considering that I am generally
time-squeezed these days.

## 2025-01-13: at-home jogging, hand gripper close failure, and abridged strength exercises

I did at-home jogging on 2025-01-13 due to having a bunch of work
meetings (including some with active participation needed and some
where I was more passive).

I had a bit of soreness in the back of the neck / shoulders yesterday
(with mor on the left shoulder), and although the feeling of soreness
was mostly gone, my strength in those areas was not yet back to
normal. As a result, I was unable to fully close the 150 lb hand
gripper with my left hand. However, when I tried later in the day, I
was able to close it, suggesting that my strength had recovered at
least to some extent.

For strength exercises, I was initially thinking of skipping, then
decided to give them a try to get a benchmark of how much I can do in
this state. I did both the usual exercises for 3 lb and 5 lb with no
difficulty but with greater experienced fatigue than usual. For 8 lb,
I did exercise 1 and then stopped. I did not do exercise 2 on 8 lb or
exercise 1 on 10 lb, partly because I was already exhausted and partly
because I didn't want to risk doing these harder exercises.

For push-ups, I stopped at around 7 or 8 instead of going to the usual
13 or higher. This reflected soreness and fatigue.

## 2025-01-16: at-home jogging due to scheduling issues

On 2025-01-16, despite good weather, I did at-home jogging due to
scheduling issues (I didn't have enough time to go out to jog before a
work meeting).

## 2025-01-17 to 2025-01-19: at-home jogging due to cold weather plus overall time constraints

From 2025-01-17 to 2025-01-19, I did at-home jogging, due to a mix of
cold weather and overall time constraints (no imminent scheduling
issues).

## 2025-01-21: skipping of all exercises except balance exercises

On Tuesday 2025-01-21, in preparation for the next day's blood draw, I
skipped all exercises except balance exercises
(standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed).

## 2025-01-22: skipping of all exercises for blood draw

On Wednesday 2025-01-22, I skipped all exercises for my blood draw,
conserving both time and energy for the blood draw.

## 2025-01-23: resumption of some exercises

On Thursday 2025-01-23, I resumed jogging (going out for it) and also
did humming-with-intermittent-pauses. I skipped hand gripper
exercises. I also didn't do standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises, but that's just because
they weren't due today as I had done them on Tuesday.

I carried back fairly heavy groceries in the evening on 2025-01-23, so
even though I didn't resume any strength exercises, this did *de
facto* play a similar role.

## 2025-01-24: resumption of hand gripper exercises (left hand only) and skipping of jogging

On Friday 2025-01-24, I skipped jogging in the morning due to time
constraints. In fact I didn't do any exercises at all in the morning.

Instead, I did hand gripper exercises with my left hand only (skipping
my right hand due to the recent blood draw from it) as well as
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises, both later in the
evening, a little under three hours after finishing my first meal.

## 2025-01-25: resumption of hand gripper exercises (right hand)

On Saturday 2025-01-25, I resumed hand gripper exercises with my right
hand. I had resumed the left hand the previous day, so this completed
the resumption of hand gripper exercises.

## 2025-01-26: resumption of strength exercises

On Sunday 2025-01-26, I resumed strength exercises (dead hang and
pull-ups). This begins a new 3-day cycle, with the next day for dumb
bells and push-ups and the third day for rest from strength exercises.

## 2025-01-27: at-home jogging and skipping of strength exercises due to time constraints and scheduling issues

On Monday 2025-01-27, I did at-home jogging and skipped strength
exercises due to a combination of time constraints and scheduling
issues.

## 2025-01-29 and 2025-01-30: at-home jogging due to cold weather, time constraints, and to allow better multiplexing

On Wednesday 2025-01-29 and Thursday 2025-01-30, I did at-home jogging
due to a mix of considerations: cold weather, time constraints, and
better multiplexing. On Wednesday, I wanted to turn the stove on at
around midway through my jog, and I need to be at home when the stove
is on. On Thursday, I multiplexed part of my jogging with a
listen-only work meeting.

## 2025-01-31: at-home jogging due to cold weather and rain, skipping of strength exercises due to scheduling constraints

On Friday 2025-01-31, I did at-home jogging due to the cold weather
and rain. I also skipped strength exercises due to scheduling
constraints (I needed to finish my second meal by a certain time, and
working backwards that worked out to a tight timeline).

## 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-02: at-home jogging due to rain and wet sidewalks

On 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-02, I did at-home jogging due to rain and
wet sidewalks. The temperature was actually fine (it was not too
cold).

## 2025-02-03: at-home jogging due to intermittent rain

On 2025-02-03, the sidewalks had mostly dried from previous rain, and
it was warm, and I was planning to go out to jog. However, as I was
getting ready to go out, I saw a weather forecast of a brief burst of
rain for the next 30 minutes. In light of this, I cancelled my plan to
go out and did at-home jogging.

## 2025-02-04: at-home jogging due to heavy rain

On 2025-02-04, I did at-home jogging due to heavy rain.

## 2025-02-05: skipping of jogging due to time constraints

2025-02-05 was finally a day of decent weather! This would have been a
good day to do exercise. However, I also wanted to make sure I got
enough time for shopping, and if I did jogging (at-home or outside)
then the post-jogging cooldown period would delay my meal and
therefore my outside trips. So, I reluctantly skipped jogging.

## 2025-02-07: jogging cut short due to watery flatulence + skipping of strength exercises

On 2025-02-07, instead of jogging+walking 2 miles, I did
jogging+walking of about 1 mile. I turned around halfway after having
a watery flatulence (the flatulence was around 12:58 PM), that I
attribute to the bowel cycle disruption yesterday where I wasn't able
to pass stool. Although I did have a large bowel movement this
morning, there was probably still some residual disruption which led
to the watery flatulence.

After getting back, I decided to end exercise for today rather than
continue with at-home jogging, giving me time to deal with the
implications of the flatulence and also allowing my body to recover
more fully from the bowel cycle disruption.

## 2025-02-12: skipped all exercises due to time-sensitive stuff with day job

On Wednesday 2025-02-12, I skipped all exercises due to time-sensitive
stuff with my day job.

## 2025-02-13: skipped most exercises to shift to an earlier sleep cycle while still getting time to wrap up time-sensitive stuff with day job

On Thursday 2025-02-13, I skipped most exercises, in particular
jogging and strength exercises, to be able to shift my sleep cycle
back to normal-ish after staying up and sleeping in late for a couple
of days due to time-sensitive stuff with the day job. Cutting exercise
made the most sense as I still had things to catch up on with the
time-sensitive stuff, so I didn't want to eat into other
time. Moreover, exercise made particular sense because doing exercises
adds not just the time of the exercise but the wait time between
exercise and meal, delaying my whole day. Shifting the day earlier is
most easily accomplished by skipping exercise.

I did do hand gripper exercises (just before my meal) as well as
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises (after my meal).

## 2025-02-14: continued skipping of strength exercises to shift to an earlier sleep cycle

On Friday 2025-02-14, I continued skipping strength exercises in order
to be able to shift to an earlier sleep cycle. My efforts on Thursday
to shift my cycle had not fully succeeded (I did go to sleep an hour
earlier, but ended up waking at the old time likely to catch up with a
slight sleep backlog).

## 2025-02-17: skipping of jogging to make time for chores and shift to an earlier sleep cycle

On Monday 2025-02-17, I skipped jogging to make time for personal
chores and shift to an earlier sleep cycle. I anyway didn't have to do
strength exercises on this day.

## 2025-02-19: at-home jogging due to wet sidewalks from rain a few hours prior

On Wednesday 2025-02-19, I did at-home jogging as the sidewalks were
wet from rain a few hours prior.

## 2025-02-22: skipping of jogging and strength exercises to make time for chores and shift to an earlier sleep cycle

On Saturday 2025-02-22, I chose to skip jogging and strength
exercises. This was in order to make time for personal chores as well
as shift to an earlier sleep cycle, in light of weather changes (it's
getting warmer, making an earlier sleep cycle more feasible) as well
as meetings earlier in the morning in the coming week.

## 2025-02-23: skipping of strength exercises in anticipation of trips to purchase weights

On Sunday 2025-02-23, I skipped strength exercises. The reason was
two-fold: first, I wanted to make sure I don't delay my first meal too
much, as part of my overall effort to adjust my sleep cycle to
earlier. Second, I anticipated that, later in the day, I would be
making trips to purchase weights, so I expected that carrying the
weights back from organically take care of strength exercise for the
day. I did end up making these trips, and they did indeed organically
take care of strength exercises for the day.

## 2025-02-27: abridged jogging due to time constraints

On Thursday 2025-02-27, I took an abridged jogging route due to time
constraints; jogging about 1.5 miles in total (no return walking)
instead of the usual range of 1.75-2.0 miles jogging and the remainder
of the 2 miles walking.

## 2025-02-28: skipped jogging due to time constraints, but carried heavy load later so got a decent amount of exercise

On Friday 2025-02-28, I skipped jogging due to time constraints
created by an impromptu work meeting (I didn't want to delay eating
too much as that would throw off my schedule). I did do the other
exercises (hand gripper, breath holds,
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed, and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed).

Later in the day, I made a trip to the Amazon Hub Locker to pick up
multiple packages. Overall, I carried a 4.2 kg suitcase one-way and a
7.6 kg load (suitcase filled with stuff) the other way, and both ways
were around 1.2-1.4 miles each. I was able to carry both ways without
needing to put the suitcase down to rest (though I had a handful of
instances where the suitcase hit the ground or my legs), so it was a
decent amount of exercise and also confirmed my strength and stamina.

## 2025-03-03: skipping jogging due to scheduling constraints

On Monday 2025-03-03, I skipped jogging due to scheduling
constraints. Specifically, I was in meetings from 11:30 AM to 1 PM and
also doing time-sensitive stuff in the gaps within and between the
meetings, so although I was able to finish hand gripper exercises,
standing-on-one-leg exercises, and the
humming-with-intermittent-pauses exercise, I did not get time for
jogging. If I then went jogging at 1 PM, that would delay the start of
my first meal to at least 2:30 PM, and probably even later, which
would delay my second meal and also delay my sleep. I didn't want to
do this, so I decided to skip jogging.

The background factor here is that the weather has taken a turn for
the cold, which is jeopardizing my recent switch to an earlier sleep
schedule, but I need to maintain that switch otherwise things will get
super-hard once the daylight savings switch happens.

## 2025-03-11: skipping jogging (and therefore also strength exercises) to help with daylight saving adjustment

On Tuesday 2025-03-11, I skipped jogging (and therefore also strength
exercises) to help me adjust more quickly to the daylight saving time
and its attendant obligations in terms of waking up earlier and
sleeping earlier. By the time I was ready to go jogging, it was
already around 1:25 PM, so going jogging would have delayed my meal
start to around 3:10 PM whereas if I didn't, I could start my meal
around 1:40 PM; this difference of 1.5 hours could be quite helpful
with helping me switch to an earlier cycle of sleeping and waking up.

I did do hand gripper exercises as usual and also took blood pressure
readings (the act of taking blood pressure readings is part of what
delayed me).

## 2025-03-12 to 2025-03-14 and 2025-03-17: at-home jogging due to rain

From Wednesday 2025-03-12 to Friday 2025-03-14 and on Monday
2025-03-17, I did at-home jogging due to the rain.

## 2025-03-18: skipping jogging due to delays and in order to be able to sleep early

On Tuesday 2025-03-18, I skipped jogging due to waking up late
(understandably given the cold and sleeping a bit late). The goal was
to be able to sleep early in light of a meeting at 10 AM tomorrow.

## 2025-03-19: skipping of all exercise and beginning of pause of strength exercises and hand gripper exercise

On Wednesday 2025-03-19, I skipped all exercise due to a meeting with
work colleagues in the morning. I also began a longer pause of
strength exercises and hand gripper exercise for a COVID-19 vaccine
appointment scheduled for Friday 2025-03-21.

## 2025-03-21 to 2025-03-23: skipping of all exercise related to COVID-19 vaccine

From Friday 2025-03-21 to Sunday 2025-03-23, I skipped all exercise
for the COVID-19 vaccine that I got on Friday 2025-03-21. See
[here](2025-03-21-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md) for details on the vaccine.

## 2025-03-24: resumption of jogging (at-home and shorter duration) and standing-with-eyes-closed exercises

On Monday 2025-03-24, three days after the COVID-19 booster dose, per
the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.d),
I resumed jogging. However, I stuck to jogging at home and jogged for
a reduced duration of about 15 minutes. The choice of at-home jogging
was due to a mix of time constraints and a desire to be more
conservative as I was still not fully back to a normal level of
energy. At-home jogging gives more flexibility to stop at any time.

I also resumed standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises.

## 2025-03-25: resumption of hand gripper exercises (left hand only); hold durations a little below the low end of typical

On Tuesday 2025-03-25, four days after the COVID-19 booster dose, per
the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.d),
I resumed hand gripper exercises in my left hand (the non-vaccine
arm).

For the 150 lb hand gripper, I managed 8 seconds in my left hand in an
almost-closed position, compared to my usual of being able to fully
close for between 10 and 25 seconds.

For the 100 lb hand gripper, I managed 20 seconds in my left hand,
compared to my usual range of 20 to 35 seconds (but this usual range
is after a much more exhausting close of the 150 lb hand gripper than
I did today).

## 2025-03-25: continued at-home jogging for shorter duration

On Tuesday 2025-03-25, I continued to stick to at-home jogging (I had
resumed at-home jogging the previous day, Monday 2025-03-24). I did
not get back to the full duration for at-home jogging of about 30
minutes, but I did go up to about 19 minutes compared to about 15
minutes yesterday.

My reasons for continuing with at-home jogging were to maintain the
flexibility to stop at any time, as well as a desire to avoid the hot
sun (uncharacteristically, the outdoor temperature was already higher
than the indoor temperature *and* it was sunny).

## 2025-03-26: resumption of breath holds and return to outside jogging reaching threshold distance

On Wednesday 2025-03-26, I resumed breath holds, with my performance
(in terms of duration of breath holds) within the normal range. I also
went for outside jogging for the first time since the vaccine. The
distance I jogged was just a little over the threshold of 1.67 miles
(I generally record when I dip below the threshold).

## 2025-03-28: resumption of hand gripper exercises in right hand

On Friday 2025-03-28, seven days after the COVID-19 booster dose, per
the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.d),
I resumed hand gripper exercises in my right hand (the vaccine arm). I
had already resumed the exercises in my left hand since Tuesday
2025-03-25 (three days ago). I was able to resume the right hand at
the usual level.

## 2025-03-28: at-home jogging due to wet sidewalks and recent rain

On Friday 2025-03-28, I opted for at-home jogging instead of going out
to jog. This was because of wet sidewalks from recent rain, even
though it did appear to have stopped raining.

## 2025-03-30: at-home jogging due to weather uncertainty and to get more time to multiplex with listening to videos

On Sunday 2025-03-30, I decided to do at-home jogging due to weather
uncertainty. It was windy and cloudy and the probability of rain was
nontrivial (and varied across forecasting services). I also wanted to
multiplex with listening to videos that might inform some decisions in
the next couple of days.

## 2025-03-30: resumption of strength exercises

On Sunday 2025-03-30, nine days after the COVID-19 booster dose, per
the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.d),
I resumed strength exercises (dumb bells, push-ups, and kettlebell
squats). I was close enough to the level I had been at prior to the
booster dose, though not quite fully at that level (my strength
endurance seemed a little bit down, so I got fewer reps in for push-ups
as I did them after the dumb bells).

## 2025-03-31: at-home jogging

On Monday 2025-03-31, I decided to do at-home jogging due to a mix of
a tight timeline, desire to multiplex, and windy outside weather.

## 2025-04-01: skipping of exercise to help me adjust my sleep cycle

On Tuesday 2025-04-01, I skipped all exercise to help adjust my sleep
cycle to earlier in the day. This was anyway a break day from strength
exercises.

## 2025-04-02: skipping of jogging and strength exercises to help me adjust my sleep cycle

On Wednesday 2025-04-02, I skipped jogging and strength exercises to
help me adjust my sleep cycle. However, I did do hand gripper
exercises, humming with intermittent pauses, and
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises as I was not vey squeezed
for time.

## 2025-04-05: skipping all exercise due to delays resulting from unexpected tax work

On Saturday 2025-04-05, I decided to skip all exercise due to delays
resulting from unexpected tax work as I realized a mistake, and
decided to fix it as soon as possible while it was still fresh in my
head. It was also quite hot by the time I was done, so in addition to
the time delay there was also the potential issue of it not being
ideal temperature-wise to exercise.

## 2025-04-06: skipping all exercise due to tax work and planned trip in the afternoon

On Sunday 2025-04-06, I decided to skip all exercise due to a mix of
doing tax work in the morning and a planned trip in the afternoon for
which timing considerations meant I didn't have a lot of time to
exercise.

## 2025-04-09: skipping jogging due to heat and to avoid delaying my day too much

On Wednesday 2025-04-09, as it was already quite warm, and it was
already around 12:30 PM by the time I was ready to go jogging, I
decided to skip jogging. However, I did finish all the other morning
exercises (hand gripper, breath holds,
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed, and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed). Strength exercises were anyway to
be skipped on this day.

## 2025-04-10 and 2025-04-11: at-home jogging due to scheduling constraints and time constraints

On Thursday 2025-04-10, I did at-home jogging to be able to multiplex
it with a listen-only work meeting.

On Friday 2025-04-11, I did at-home jogging so that I could start the
heating portion of rice prep. It had already been about 40 minutes
since I had finished the soaking, so it was time for the cooking
portion. The delay was due to a few time-sensitive tasks on the day
job that came up after I was done soaking but before I went jogging.

## 2025-04-16: skipped all exercises for dental cleaning

On Wednesday 2025-04-16, I skipped all exercises for my [dental
cleaning appointment](2025-04-16-dental-cleaning.md).

## 2025-04-17: skipped strength exercises due to slight fatigue and soreness after dental cleaning (and to save time)

On Thursday 2025-04-17, I still had a bit of residual soreness after
the dental cleaning yesterday (a bit of head/neck/shoulder soreness
after dental cleaning is expected). It was a lot better than the
previous day, but out of caution I decided to skip strength
exercises. I still did the usual hand gripper exercises and jogging.

## 2025-04-22, 2025-04-23, and 2025-04-24: skipped strength exercises

On Tuesday 2025-04-22, due to a house issue that both directly took
some of my time and made it more challenging to efficiently multiplex
strength exercises with listening to videos, I decided to skip
strength exercises. My plan was to do them the next day instead.

On Wednesday 2025-04-23, due to delays and some stuff at work that I
wanted to wrap up, I deferred strength exercises again.

On Thursday 2025-04-24, I ended up deferring strength exercises again,
because a bunch of work meetings ended relatively late and I wanted to
stick to the sleep cycle adjustment plan.

## 2025-04-24: at-home jogging due to time considerations for sleep cycle adjustment

On Thursday 2025-04-24, I did at-home jogging as I wanted to adjust my
sleep cycle toward sleeping earlier and also wanted to cook food in
the morning, so I wanted to jog earlier, but it was too cold to go
out that early.

## 2025-04-25: skipped all exercises due to time considerations

On Friday 2025-04-25, I skipped all exercises due to delays as a
result of trying to get some day job work done (I'm trying to wrap up
a bunch of small items at the day job, some of which I had not
planned, ahead of reduced availability in the coming weeks). The
reason was a combination of "it's getting late and I should eat soon
if I want to get back to a good sleep cycle" as well as "I am squeezed
for time in general and exercise is the thing that's easiest to cut."

## 2025-04-26: skipped all exercises due to time considerations

On Saturday 2025-04-26, I skipped all exercises due to delays as a
result of trying to wrap up some work stuff as well as some overall
task planning. Same as the previous day, the reason was a combination
of "it's getting late and I should eat soon if I want to get back to a
good sleep cycle" as well as "I am squeezed for time in general and
exercise is the thing that's easiest to cut."

## 2025-04-27: at-home jogging and slight reductions to various strength exercises due to left hand muscle pain

On Sunday 2025-04-27, I did at-home jogging so that I could do jogging
earlier than the ideal time temperature-wise to do jogging, as part of
efforts to maintain an early sleep cycle.

I also made a few deliberate reductions to strength exercises due to
left hand muscle pain (that I currently believe to be nociplastic and
not associated to tissue damage, but still aggravated by heavy strain
that ramps up the sensitization to that hand)

* For the 150 lbs hand gripper, I closed it in my left hand but did
  not hold (so I kept it in closed position for about a second or
  less). This was proactive (trying to avoi exacerbating pain later)
  rather than due to me being unable to hold for longer.

* For the 100 lbs hand gripper, I held closed in my left hand for
  about 25 seconds and then deliberately let go, even though I could
  likely have held for at least another 5 seconds. The decision to let
  go early was driven by a desire to reduce pain later.

* For the 20 lbs dumb bells, I held them in both hands, but did the
  biceps curls only with my right hand (so I kept the weight down in
  my left hand while doing the biceps curls). The 20 lbs dumb bells
  are something I started recently, and based on timing, a likely
  contributor to left hand muscle pain.

* For the kettlebells, I did the normal squats but did not do a
  single-hand hold of the kettlebell in my left hand after that; I
  only did that with my right hand.

* I skipped push-ups, given the strain of weight these place on the wrist.

In addition to these deliberate choices, I also noticed slight
reductions in my number of repetitions for the exercises where I do a
variable number of repetitions based on fatigue. This suggests a bit
more fatigue, or possibly a bit of deconditioning from not having done
strength exercises for a while (skipping them on two days and then
skipping all exercises on the next two days).

## 2025-04-30: skipped hand gripper exercises and strength exercises

On Wednesday 2025-04-30, I skipped hand gripper exercises and strength
exercises to conserve both time and energy for stuff in the coming
days, specifically my travel to India.

## 2025-05-01 to 2025-05-06: skipped all exercises

When 2025-05-01 (in Pacific Time) to 2025-05-06 (in Indian Standard
Time) I skipped all exercises, to conserve time and energy for my
travel to India.

## 2025-05-07 onward: resumed exercises except strength exercises

Starting Wednesday 2025-05-07, I resumed jogging, hand gripper
exercises, and (not every day) other exercises such as breath holds,
humming with intermittent pauses,
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed, and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed. I continued to skip strength
exercises as my strength gradully returned post-travel.

## 2025-05-09, 2025-05-12, 2025-05-15, and 2025-05-23: skipped all exercises to save time and energy for outside trips

On Friday 2025-05-09, Monday 2025-05-12, Thursday 2025-05-15, and
Friday 2025-05-23, I skipped all exercises to save tim and energy for
outside trips on the respective days.

## 2025-05-13: resumed strength exercises

On Tuesday 2025-05-13, in India, I resumed strength exercises
including dumb bells, kettlebells, and push-ups. I did not do the very
heavy dumb bell (9 kg / 20 lb) but did most of the rest as usual, with
slight adaptations due to differences in the equipment available. The
number of repetitions was a little lower than usual, reflecting that
my return to strength was not complete after the travel and the break
from strength exercises.

## 2025-05-20 and 2025-05-26: at-home jogging

On Tuesday 2025-05-20 and Monday 2025-05-26, I did at-home jogging due
to rain and/or wet ground from recent rain. On 2025-05-26, I also
skipped the strength exercises that would normally have been due on
that day.

## 2025-05-27: skipped jogging and strength exercises

On Tuesday 2025-05-27, in India, I skipped jogging and strength
exercises as I had spent the morning doing tax work and it was getting
late and I didn't want to delay my meal too much.

## 2025-06-05 to 2025-06-17: skipped all exercises

From Thursday 2025-06-05 to Tuesday 2025-06-17, I skipped all exercises.

The initial skipping was due to travel (Friday 2025-06-06 to Saturday
2025-06-07). If that had been it, I would have started resuming
exercise on Tuesday 2025-06-10. However, I continued skipping exercise
due to a [respiratory infection (likely the common
cold)](2025-06-respiratory-infection-likely-common-cold.md).

## 2025-06-18: resumed some exercises

On Wednesday 2025-06-18, I resumed hand gripper exercises, the
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise, and the
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercise.

### Standing exercises: normal performance

For both the standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise, and the
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercise, my performance was within
normal range. For the former, I exceeded the minimum threshold on the
first try for each leg. For the latter, I exceeded the minimum
threshold on the second try. Needing a second try isn't super-rare
evne under normal circumstance.

### Hand gripper exercises: below-normal performance and comparable with the level about 10 months ago

For the hand gripper exercise, I was able to close both the 150 lbs
and 100 lbs hand grippers, but my hold durations were lower than they
normally are, indicating some mix of deconditioning and continued
lower energy due to recovery from the common cold.

Specifically, these were my hold durations: 150 lbs: 12s in right
hand, 3s in left hand; 100 lbs: 20s in right hand, 17s in left
hand. These are less than the hold duration ranges specified in the
[hand gripper exercise
doc]((../../profile-information/physical-exercise/hand-gripper-exercise-with-history.md#first-of-alternating-days-focus-on-maintaining).

Even so, it's comparable to the level I was at as recently as
2024-08-02, judging from the [hand gripper exercise
doc](../../profile-information/physical-exercise/hand-gripper-exercise-with-history.md#update-on-2024-08-02). This
suggests that even with deconditioning or reduced energy, I am not
back to square one.

## 2025-06-19: resumed jogging and some strength exercises (dead hang and pull-ups)

On Thursday 2025-06-19, I resumed jogging as well as some strength
exercises, specifically dead hang and pull-ups.

### Jogging

For jogging, my jogging distance was way less than normal. It was
about 1.25 miles (walking back the remaining 0.75 miles), which used
to be my lower threshold a little over a year ago (though I normally
did at least 1.4 miles), and is lower than my current ideal conditions
threshold of 1.67 milesq. The constraining factor that led me to stop
was nasal congestion due to mucus buildup. I had cleared my nose a few
minutes before going jogging, so the duration of jogging (about 15
minutes) should not have been enough to cause that much mucus
buildup. It's likely that the greater respiratory exertion triggered
by jogging triggered increased nasal congestion per unit time. This
does suggest that the aftereffects of my common cold are not
completely gone; they're not too visible for sedentary work but they
become more obvious in the context of exertion.

I was also generally feeling system-wide sluggishness as well as
transient soreness in parts of my legs. I attribute these to some mix
of the recovery process and being deconditioned. I expect that even if
it hadn't been for the nasal congestion, I would still have jogged
less than 1.67 miles, but more than the 1.25 miles. Probably I would
have landed at around 1.5 miles, which is my significantly degraded
conditions threshold.

### Dead hang and pull-ups

For dead hang, I did 25 oscillations over and 11 oscillations
under. The number of over oscillations was at the low end of my range
of 25 to 38; the number of under oscillations was aound the median
value.

For pull-ups, I did 3 over and 2 under, compared to my norm of 4 to 5
over and 3 to 4 under.

So for both, I was a little lower than or at the low end of my norm,
which likely reflects a mix of ongoing recovery and deconditioning.

## 2025-06-20: continued ramp-up of jogging

On Friday 2025-06-20, I went jogging again. I jogged a longer distance
than the previous day, but still below my thresholds; my jogging
distance was about 1.4 miles (walking back the remaining 0.6
miles). The constraining factor was a mix of nasal congestion and
systemwide fatigue, but the nasal congestion wasn't as bad as
yesterday; I was able to hold till I got back home to blow my nose.

## 2025-06-21: jogging at threshold distance and resumption of weight-lifting

On Saturday 2025-06-21, I went jogging again. This time, my jogging
distance returned to being just at the threshold of 1.67 miles. I did
not experience nasal congestion though I still felt a little
deconditioned relative to my norm.

After getting home, I resumed weight-lifting. I did all the usual
categories of weight-lifting, with almost the usual number of
repetitions. The push-ups, that were at the end, suffered the most,
and I ended up only doing 10 repetitions of those.

## 2025-06-23: skipped exercises due to a morning time squeeze

On Monday 2025-06-23, I skipped exercises due to a time squeeze in the
morning, including two shopping trips for stuff I wanted to buy before
it got too warm and before my first meal, plus rice prep, plus work
meetings and time-sensitive work tasks.

## 2025-06-26: skipped jogging due to a morning time squeeze

On Thursday 2025-06-26, I finished my pre-jogging exercises (hand
gripper, breath holds, and balance exercises) but then didn't have
much time left before a bunch of work-related meetings. By the time
the meetings ended, it was too late to go jogging, so I skipped
jogging for the day.

## 2025-06-30: short at-home jogging due to time constraints and scheduling issues

On Monday 2025-06-30, I did at-home jogging due to time constraints
and scheduling issues: I had a work meeting and other work-related
items and other items in the morning, but I also wanted to do eggplant
meal prep prior to my first meal. By jogging at home and doing a
shorter duration, I was able to reduce my time spent jogging and start
the eggplant meal prep sooner.

## 2025-07-03: skipped all exercises due to a morning time squeeze

On Thursday 2025-07-03, I skipped all exercises because a work meeting
start 10:30 AM ended up going much longer, and I hadn't had time to
get started on exercises prior to the meeting.

## 2025-07-05: at-home jogging to be able to start the heat for cooking sooner

On Saturday 2025-07-05, I did at-home jogging instead of going out to
jog so that I could start the heat for cooking rice sooner. If I'd
gone out jogging, I would only be able to start the heat after getting
back, whereas this way, I was able to start the heat a few minutes
after starting jogging.

## 2025-07-07: skipped all exercises due to scheduling and time availability constraints

On Monday 2025-07-07, I skipped all exercises. This was due to a mix
of scheduling and time availability constraints. There was a
confluence of several factors:

* I stayed up late the previous day, due to scheduling constraints and
  a few time-sensitive matters. So I woke up late in the morning.

* I had a bunch of work meetings in the morning and afternoon,
  reducing my flexibility to step away from the computer.

* I wanted to do eggplant meal prep in the morning prior to my first
  meal (this also fit well in terms of multiplexing with a subset of
  the meetings).

Due to a combination of these factors, I decided it was best to skip
all exercises.

## 2025-07-10: at-home jogging (shorter than usual) and skipping of strength exercises

On Thursday 2025-07-10, I did at-home jogging for a shorter duration
interval than usual due to scheduling issues / time constraints. I
also skipped the once-every-three-days strength exercises that I would
normally do after jogging on this day (the plan being to do them the
next day instead).

## 2025-07-11: skipped all exercise

On Friday 2025-07-11, I skipped all exercise due to a mix of time
constraints and the need to conserve energy levels as I focused my
attention on a time-sensitive investigation at work.

## 2025-07-13: at-home jogging

On Sunday 2025-07-13, I did at-home jogging for scheduling reasons --
it was already late and I wanted to effectively multiplex jogging with
the cooking of rice, which I could only do by jogging at home.

## 2025-07-14: skipped all exercise

On Monday 2025-07-14, I skipped all exercise. This was because I had
an impromptu meeting with a work colleague just around the time I was
planning to go for (delayed) exercise, right on the heels of another
meeting that delayed my intended start time of exercise.

## 2025-07-15: skipped all exercise

On Tuesday 2025-07-15, I skipped all exercise. This was due to a bunch
of time-sensitive stuff in the morning, as I am trying to wrap up
several items.

## 2025-07-17: skipped all exercise to begin with, but did a few exercises later in the day

On Thursday 2025-07-17, I initially skipped all exercise. This was due
to a bunch of time-sensitive stuff in the morning and early afternoon.

However, later in the day, I did some exercises that don't involve a
lot of energy and strength use: I did balance exercises, hand gripper
exercises (hand gripper exercises use local strength but are not
exhausting on the system as a whole), and humming with intermittent
pauses.

## 2025-07-24: skipped all exercise

On Thursday 2025-07-24, I skipped all exercise in the morning. This
was because of scheduling constraints -- I had meetings in the morning
and early afternoon, and I also wanted to do eggplant meal prep prior
to my first meal.

## 2025-07-31: skipped most exercises

On Thursday 2025-07-31, I skipped most exercises in the morning. The
only exercises I did were the hand gripper exercises. The reason for
skipping exercises was a morning meeting that ended up going longer
than usual.

## 2025-08-01: skipped all exercises

On Friday 2025-08-01, I skipped all exercises. This was so that I
could get started with meal prep in the morning and also multiplex it
with a morning meeting.

## 2025-08-03: skipped all exercises

On Sunday 2025-08-03, I skipped all exercises. This was so that I
could do meal prep in the morning and spend the afternoon and evening
making progress with my backlog of tasks.

## 2025-08-04: at-home jogging and skipping of strength exercises

On Monday 2025-08-04, I did at-home jogging and skipped strength
exercises (I had dead hang and pull-ups due). The at-home jogging was
due to a time crunch (several meetings in the day). The skipping of
strength exercises was because something came up right after I
finished at-home jogging and I missed my time window to do strength
exercises.

## 2025-08-06: shortened at-home jogging and reduced quantity of strength exercises

On Wednesday 2025-08-06, due to a mix of general physical lethargy /
fatigue and a desire to finish exercise sooner so as to move my sleep
cycle back to normal, I deviated from my usual exercise routine in the
following ways:

* I did at-home jogging, and only jogged for 20 minutes instead of the
  usual 30 minutes for at-home jogging.

* For strength exercises, I stopped at 10 lbs exercise 1. I skipped 10
  lbs exercise 2 and the exercises I do with 20 lbs.

* For kettlebell squats, I only did 10 squats each pointing inward and
  outward, compared to my usual of doing at least 25 total across
  inward and outward.

* I skipped all push-ups (both standard push-ups and fist push-ups).

## 2025-08-07: skipped all exercises

On Thursday 2025-08-07, I skipped all exercises. This was due to a
very busy morning and early afternoon, plus my desire to not delay my
meal so that I could adjust to a slightly earlier time of sleep and
waking up.

## 2025-08-08: at-home jogging and execution of strength exercises rather than breath hold and balance exercises

On Friday 2025-08-08, both because it had already gotten pretty hot
outdoors and to save time and multiplex it more effectively, I did
at-home jogging. I also did one of the strength exercise routines
rather than the breath hold and balance exercises that I would have
done based on displacement from skipping exercises the previous
day. This was based on a judgment call that in light of being busy and
skipping exercise, I wanted to prioritize strength exercises on the
days I did do exercise, as strength is an area where I am still trying
to grow, whereas the other areas I am at or close to a state of
maintaining, so a bit of decline is acceptable. Strength is also an
area where I am more likely to slip up in hot seasons due to reduced
protein intake accompanying reduced calorie intake, so I want to
prioritize maintaining the stimulus from the exercise side.

## 2025-08-09: skipped jogging and breath holds

On Saturday 2025-08-09, I skipped all exercises in the morning so that
I could start meal prep in the morning before my first meal (I had run
out of unprepped food). I also deferred all other exercise for the
meal prep. However, later in the day, I did get a chance to do hand
gripper exercises (while waiting on the potatoes prep to get ready)
and a few balance exercises (while waiting for water to be filtered
for rice prep), so in effect I only skipping jogging and breath holds.

## 2025-08-10: skipped all exercises

On Sunday 2025-08-10, I skipped all exercises due to a hectic schedule
as well as some general fatigue.

## 2025-08-13 to 2025-08-15: skipped all exercises (except hand gripper exercises that I did on two days)

From Wednesday 2025-08-13 to Friday 2025-08-15, I skipped all
exercises with the exception of hand gripper exercises, that I did on
Wednesday and Friday (not Thursday). The reason was a bunch of
time-sensitive stuff that I needed to complete over the period; doing
exercises would have both taken time and disrupted the overall
schedule for the day.

## 2025-08-18 to 2025-08-20: skipped all exercises

From Monday 2025-08-18 to Wednesday 2025-08-20, I skipped all
exercises, to focus on a bunch of time-sensitive administrative stuff.

## 2025-08-21: reduced at-home jogging plus continued skipping of strength exercises

On Thursday 2025-08-21, partly due to time constraints and partly to
allow myself to recondition back to normal after three days of not
exercising, I only did hand gripper exercises and at-home jogging,
with the latter being for a shorter duration than usual. I skipped
strength exercises.

The reason for jogging at home was a mix of time constraints and it
being very hot and sunny outside (the indoor temperature was also high
but not as high as the outdoor temperature which rose pretty sharply
in the morning, plus it was also sunny outside so subjectively hotter
after controlling for temperature).

## 2025-08-23: at-home jogging

On Saturday 2025-08-23, I did at-home jogging. That's because I got
delayed starting my jog because I decided to finish a few other tasks
first, and by the time I finally was ready to go jogging, it was hot
outdoors. I did the full at-home jogging duration and did other
exercises as usual.

## 2025-08-25: at-home jogging and skipping of strength exercises

On Monday 2025-08-25, I did at-home jogging due to a mix of it being
hot and things being busy with work meetings. I also skipped strength
exercises that would normally be due on the day.

## 2025-08-26: skipping of strength exercises

On Tuesday 2025-08-26, when I returned from jogging, I had to attend
to a few tasks, so I ended up skipping strength exercises that I had
due on that day.

## 2025-08-27: at-home jogging

On Wednesday 2025-08-27, I did at-home jogging because it had gotten
late and it was hot outdoors.

## 2025-08-28: at-home jogging and skipping of strength exercises

On Thursday 2025-08-28, I did at-home jogging and skipped strength
exercises due to a scheduling issue / time crunch imposed by a work
meeting.

## 2025-08-29: at-home jogging

On Friday 2025-08-29, I did at-home jogging because it got pretty late
by the time I was ready to go jogging, and it was fairly hot outside
by this time.

## 2025-08-30 to 2025-09-01: at-home jogging

On Saturday 2025-08-30, Sunday 2025-08-31, and Monday 2025-09-01, I
did at-home jogging because it was fairly hot in the morning (and in
fact hotter outdoors than indoors, in addition to being sunny
outdoors).

## 2025-09-03: skipping of all exercises

On Wednesday 2025-09-03, I skipped all exercise due to physical and
cognitive fatigue as well as having spent a lot of time doing typing
practice that used up the time I would normally spend exercising.

## 2025-09-04: skipping of most exercises

On Thursday 2025-09-04, I skipped most exercises due to a bunch of day
job work in the morning. I did, however, do hand gripper exercises.

## 2025-09-05: at-home jogging

On Friday 2025-09-05, I did at-home jogging for a mix of scheduling
reasons and the temperature increasing outdoors by the time I was
ready to go jogging.

## 2025-09-07 and 2025-09-08: at-home jogging

On Sunday 2025-09-07 and Monday 2025-09-08, I did at-home jogging. On
Sunday, the reason was that it had already gotten hot by the time I
was ready to go jogging. On Monday, the reason was that I was
multiplexing with meetings and other work obligations.

## 2025-09-09 to 2025-09-15: skipping and subsequent resumption of various exercises in light of blood tests

On Tuesday 2025-09-09, I skipped all exercises in preparation for
blood tests the next day. I continued skipping exercises the next day
(Wednesday 2025-09-10).

On Thursday 2025-09-11, I resumed jogging.

On Friday 2025-09-12, I resumed hand gripper exercises in both hands.

On Monday 2025-09-15, I resumed strength exercises. My original intent
had been to resume strength exercises on Sunday 2025-09-14, but I
skipped all exercises on that day for other reasons.

## 2025-09-14: skipping of all exercises due to scheduling issues and time availability

On Sunday 2025-09-14, I skipped all exercises due to a mix of
scheduling issues and general time availability. I had a meeting in
the morning, and to achieve efficient time use, I decided to multiplex
it with the potatoes prep that was due, which in turn meant that I
needed to skip morning exercise as I didn't hve time for morning
exercise prior to the meeting.

## 2025-09-16: skipping of all exercises due to scheduling issues and time availability

On Tuesday 2025-09-16, I skipped all exercises due to a mix of
scheduling issues and general time availability. First, I got up a
little late because I had stayed up a little late the previous
night. Second, I had a number of small work-related items to catch up
on. By the time I was done with them, I realized that if I did
exercise, it would delay my meal a lot and get in the way of returning
to my normal sleep / waking up routine.

## 2025-09-17: skipping of all exercises to get groceries

On Wednesday 2025-09-17, I skipped all exercises so I could make a
trip in the morning to get groceries from Trader Joe's. My intent had
been to cook in the afternoon, though I ended up not doings o.

## 2025-09-18: skipping of all exercises due to scheduling issues and time availability

On Thursday 2025-09-18, I skipped all exercises due to a mix of
scheduling issues and time availability. I had a meeting in the
morning, and just about enough time before that to do rice prep, which
I needed to get started on in order to be able to do both rice prep
and eggplant meal prep within the same day.

## 2025-09-19 and 2025-09-20: at-home jogging

On Friday 2025-09-19 and Saturday 2025-09-20, I did at-home jogging
since it was hot outside, and also to save time as I was already
somewhat delayed.

## 2025-09-22: at-home jogging

On Monday 2025-09-22, I did at-home jogging since it was hot outside,
and also for scheduling reasons as I wanted to have enough of a time
buffer before an upcoming meeting.

NOTE: Going forward (after 2025-09-22), since at-home jogging is
fairly common nowadays, I will skip recording cases of at-home jogging
as long as the amount of jogging is consistent with my typical at-home
jogging amount (about 30 minutes). I'll continue to record cases of
abridged at-home jogging.

The information on whether I did at-home jogging will continue to be
available in my Slack self-chat logs.

## 2025-09-24: skipped all exercises

On Wednesday 2025-09-24, I skipped all exercise, so that I could make
time in the morning for a Berkeley Bowl trip. I anticipated being busy
in the afternoon/evening with other stuff.

## 2025-09-25: skipped jogging and strength exercises

On Thursday 2025-09-25, I skipped jogging and strength
exercises. However, I did do hand gripper exercises and also did
balance exercises and breath holds that I have not been doing
regularly.

The skipping was due to a time squeeze as I had meetings in the
morning and needed to make an administrative trip in the afternoon.

## 2025-09-26: skipped jogging and strength exercises

On Friday 2025-09-26, I skipped jogging and strength exercises, but
did hand gripper exercises. The skipping was because I needed to make
a food purchase trip and also cook food, leaving very little time to
fit exercise in.

## 2025-09-27: skipped all exercises

On Saturday 2025-09-27, I skipped all exercises. The skipping was
because I needed to make a food purchase trip and also cook food,
leaving very little time to fit exercise in.

## 2025-10-02: shorter at-home jogging and skipped planned strength exercises

On Thursday 2025-10-02, I did shorter at-home jogging than usual, due
to not having a lot of time before a work meeting. I was also
therefore unable to take time for strength exercises. I also skipped
hand gripper exercises because I wanted to make sure to get some
jogging in and thought that the hand gripper exercises can be done
later.

However, a little later in the day, when I had the opportunity of
catching up with the hand gripper exercises, I felt a sudden onset of
chills and malaise. Although I got back to a level close enough to
normal, skipping further exercise felt prudent.

## 2025-10-03: skipping of all exercises, but natural exercise carrying stuff from Amazon Hub Locker

On Friday 2025-10-03, I skipped all exercises, partly due to health
issues, partly due to time-sensitive stuff in the morning, and partly
to save time and energy for an Amazon Hub Locker trip later in the
day.

Walking back from the Amazon Hub Locker at ASUC Berkeley, I carried in
my hand a suitcase weighing about 10.5 kg and carrying on my sholders
a backpack weighing about 3.9 kg; both of them had some of the items
from the Amazon Hub Locker pickup. I carried the suitcase back rather
than wheeling it, but I did have to stop to put the suitcase down
several times on the way home.

## 2025-10-05: interrupted at-home jogging for typing practice

On Sunday 2025-10-05, I did at-home jogging due to heat. However,
rather than jog continuously for 30 minutes, I interrupted jogging
several times for typing practice, so I effectively jogged about 15 of
the 30 minutes. I did things this way partly to cap my total time on
exercise-like stuff, though I ended up doing more typing practice
before and after jogging as well.

## 2025-10-08: skipped all exercises due to scheduling challenges

On Wednesday 2025-10-08, I had a once-every-few-months lengthy
catch-up meeting with work colleagues in the morning. This created
scheduling challenges for exercise, so I decided to skip all
exercises.

## 2025-10-13: skipped all exercises due to scheduling challenges

On Monday 2025-10-13, I skipped all exercises so I could do eggplant
meal prep in the morning and efficiently multiplex the preparation and
meal consumption with several work meetings.

## 2025-10-16: skipped all exercises due to a busy morning and early afternoon

On Thursday 2025-10-16, I had a busy morning, including about an hour
of meetings and a lot more time dealing with a bunch of incoming and
pending tasks. As a result, I didn't get time to do exercises. In
fact, I only got a breather to break to eat at around 2:15 PM.

## 2025-10-17: reduced at-home jogging due to time constraints

On Friday 2025-10-17, I did at-home jogging for a reduced duration
(about 18 minutes instead of the full 30 minutes) so that I could
finish exercise sooner, and therefore eat sooner. I was already
delayed for the day, and wanted to increase the chances that I get
enough time to do my planned tasks for the day, some of which were

## 2025-10-23: skipped strength exercises

## 2025-10-27: reduced at-home jogging and skipped strength exercises

On Monday 2025-10-27, I did reduced at-home jogging (20 minutes minus
interruptions, so effectively about 15 minutes, instead of the usual
full at-home jogging duration of 30 minutes) and skipped strength
exercises. This was mostly due to a mix of scheduling considerations
and things just getting very late (I did not want to delay my meal
time too much).

## 2025-10-28: skipped jogging and strength exercises

On Tuesday 2025-10-28, I skipped jogging and strength exercises. The
reason is mostly running out of time; I started the day late to begin
with, had a few work-related things to wrap up in the morning, and
then after my hand gripper exercises I decided to get started on a few
software updates that could proceed while I did at-home jogging. But
there were various additional hands-on item to address along with the
software updates and by the time I was done with those, scheduling
considerations meant I didn't have time for exercise.
