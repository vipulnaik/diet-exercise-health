# 2025-06: potential infection

Details to be filled in later as I feel better and have more time
(I've privately recorded the individual pieces but need to cohere them
into a narrative).

I suspect an infection that my body is fighting off from the air travel I did from Friday 2025-06-06 to Saturday 2025-06-07 from Bengaluru to San Francisco.

* Symptoms started overnight / morning of Monday 2025-06-09, two days
  after arrival. I was clear of symptoms for 2025-06-07 and
  2025-06-08.

* List of symptoms:

  * Sore throat starting Monday 2025-06-09, continuing into Tuesday 2025-06-10

  * Occasional chills, plus subjective temperature perception off by
    about 2-3 degrees Celsius from usual, starting Monday2025-06-09,
    continuing into Tuesday 2025-06-10

  * Transient aches around body intermittently, similar to those
    experienced after COVID vaccines (intermittent on 2025-06-09 and
    2025-06-10, not bothersome on its own)

  * Experience of fluid buildup near left ear on mostly 2025-06-09
    (this tends to happen with sore throat and reflux in general),
    back to normal-ish on 2025-06-10

* Concerning vitals:

  * First SpO2 measurement on 2025-06-10 was 85-92%, but second was
    normal (95-96%); see
    [pulse_oximeter_readings.sql](../../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql)

  * Nothing concerning about heart rate (55-60 bpm and 53-65 bpm)

* Hypotheses:

  * Respiratory infections (airborne): I did mask up for the flight
    but may still have gotten a respiratory infection given the long
    duration, unmasking for meals, etc.

    * COVID-19: Negative at-home test done 2025-06-10 (details to be
      documented from private notes later) but may still have a small
      viral load

    * Flu: Haven't done a test as I don't have one at home

  * GI infection (foodborne): I did feel that a bit of the food on the
    plane didn't agree with me, and experienced a looser motion than
    usual the afternoon of 2025-06-07, but got back to normal-ish
    starting 2025-06-08.
