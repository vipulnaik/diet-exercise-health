## Appointment booking

I booked my appointment for the COVID vaccine (indicating a preference
for Pfizer) on Saturday March 1. The appointment is for Friday March
21 at 3 PM at the 2801 Adeline Street location.

I followed the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
for the process. In particular, this included checking my calendar and
on-call schedule around the time, picking the recommended day of week
and time of day, and checking for other events in the two weeks before
and after. I also blocked off time on my calendar for the vaccine
appointment and did the other setup (including on-call changes and
calendar reminders) based on guidance in the best practices doc.

### Consent form

After booking the vaccine, I filled the consent form. The questions were as follows:

* Do you have a history of allergic reactions or allergies to latex,
  medications, food, or vaccines (e.g., polyethylene glycol,
  polysorbate, eggs, bovine protein, gelatin, gentamicin, polymyxin,
  neomycin, phenol, yeast, or thimerosal)?

  Answer: No

* Have you ever had a reaction after receiving a vaccination,
  including fainting or feeling dizzy?

  Answer: No

* Have you ever had a seizure disorder for which you are on seizure
  medication(s), a brain disorder, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (a
  condition that causes paralysis) or other nervous system problem?

  Answer: No

* Have you received any vaccinations or skin tests in the past eight weeks?

  Answer: No

* Check any vaccinations you've received in the past. Include a best estimate for the month(MM) and year(YYYY) of each vaccination.

  Pneumonia: did not check

  Shingles: did not check

  Whooping cough: checked, and entered 07/2024 for the [Tdap vaccine
  booster
  dose](../2024/2024-07-12-tdap-vaccine-booster-dose.md).

* Do you have any chronic health condition(s) such as cancer, chronic
  kidney disease, immunocompromised, chronic lung disease, obesity,
  sickle cell disease, diabetes, asthma or heart disease?

  Answer: No

* Have you been treated with antibody therapy (monoclonal antibodies
  or convalescent plasma) specifically for COVID-19?

  Answer: No

## Preparation

### Strength exercises and hand gripper exercise paused on 2025-03-19

On Wednesday 2025-03-19, I paused strength exercises and hand gripper
exercise. This was consistent with the calendar reminder I had put in
place.

### Weather check on the evening of 2025-03-19

On the evening of Wednesday 2025-03-19, I checked the weather and
confirmed that the time of the vaccine administration is forecast to
not have rain and to be reasonably warm (temperature range of 61-62
degrees Fahrenheit).

### Shopping and laundry done on 2025-03-19 and 2025-03-20

I did shopping at Berkeley Bowl on 2025-03-19 and at Trader Joe's on
2025-03-20. I did regular laundry on 2025-03-19 and heavy laundry on
2025-03-20, so my shopping and laundry needs in the days right after
the vaccine are minimal.

### Packing / prep on the morning of 2025-03-21

While packing / prep is ideally done the previous evening, the
previous evening was hectic with laundry completion, so I deferred
packing / prep to the morning. This included packing the COVID-19
vaccine card as well as looking into my California digital vaccine
record situation.

## Appointment

### Arrival and attempt to do self-check-in

I arrived at the self-check-in area at 2:38 PM (compared to
appointment time of 3 PM and reporting time of 2:45 PM), took a photo
of the QR code, and started the check-in. After the check-in, I was
asked to fill in a health status, which I did and then submitted, but
it then got stuck in a loading state. I waited till about 2:42 PM,
then tried again and ran into the same issue.

### Interaction with counter

At around 2:46 PM, I was called to the counter. While my check-in had
been received, my online form had not gotten through, so I was asked
to answer the questions again. I gave the month and year of recent
vaccinations (flu, Tdap, and COVID-19).

For insurance, I was asked if my insurance information remained the
same. I mentioned that I had [switched from PPO to HMO starting
2025](2025-switch-from-ppo-to-hmo.md) so one of the letters in my
insurance ID had changed. I gave a paper printout of my electronic
insurance card. The person at the counter said that the insurance
process only cares about the numeric part of the insurance ID, and
also confirmed that none of the information relevant for the
Walgreens/Blue Shield connection.

The person at the counter also did a quick run to confirm that the
Pfizer COVID vaccine was in stock.

At around 2:52 PM, I was given a printout of the filled form. I asked
if I should step aside to review and sign it. But the person at the
counter suggested I stay there so it could be finished while she still
had my transaction open in the system. So I reviewed, signed, and
dated the form and returned it. I was then given an information sheet
and asked to wait on the side while the pharmacist enters the
information, with the understanding that after that happens, they'll
"ring me up" even though I won't actually have to pay or even insert a
payment card.

### Checkout

I was finally called at around 3:10 PM for checkout. I entered the
phone number for identification and then also entered my phone number
again to get Walgreens Rewards. Unlike past practice, I was not given
the folded pamphlet with the details of the exact vaccine (that also
serves as receipt) and instead told that I'll get it along with the
actual vaccine injection. I left at 3:12 PM and moved to the waiting
area for the vaccine room.

### Waiting for vaccine administration

I took out my COVID-19 vaccine record card. I walked around for a
little bit, but got a bit tired and stressed in my left shoulder, so
at around 3:25 PM I decided to sit down with the backpack on the
floor.

### Vaccine administration

At 3:30 PM I was called inside. For identification I was asked to
confirm my date of birth. I gave the pharmacist my vaccine record
card, told her I want the vaccine in my right arm, then removed my
sweatshirt and sat down. She filled in the vaccine details in the
vaccine record card and gave it back to me. I pulled and held my shirt
sleeve up. She administered the vaccine dose and then put a bandage on
top of it. She also handed me the pamphlet that also serves as my
receipt. This specified the medication as Comirnaty and the dose as
0.3ml.

She told me to wait for 15 minutes in the store. She then
left the vaccine room.

I put my sweatshirt back on, put the vaccine record card and pamphlet
in my backpack, confirmed I have all my belongings, and exited the
vaccine room at around 3:32 PM.

### Waiting after vaccine administration

I waited in front of the vaccine room, mostly seated, till around 3:46
PM; for the last few minutes I caught up with messages on my phone. At
3:46 PM I got up and left.

### Return journey

I stopped at the Berkeley Bowl opposite the Walgreens to buy some
stuff, finishing checkout there at 3:59 PM. I then headed back home.

## Aftereffects

### Soreness at injection site

I first took note of the soreness at the vaccine injection site at
7:07 PM on the day of the vaccine, noting "clear soreness on touch and
slight soreness otherwise". As expected, the soreness was maximal over
the bandage (so right around where the injection happened) but also it
wasn't symmetrical around it -- it was more as I mved up my arm than
as I moved down my arm. In fact, there was almost no soreness even on
touch right below the bandage, but there was clearly some above the
bandage.

The soreness was not distracting, so unless I touched the area or
directed my thoughts to it, it didn't get in my way.

The soreness was also only a minor deterrent to sleeping on my right
side that night. A little bit of care with posture to make sure that I
was not putting too much weight on the bandaged area was enough to
have a reasonably decent sleep even when on my right side.

I removed the bandage on 2025-03-23 around 11:34 PM. This was about 2
days and 8 hours after the vaccine administration.

### Holistic fatigue

I did observe a few interesting symptoms of holistic fatigue.

Around 7:54 PM, after getting up briefly to check on the rice being
cooked, I noticed that when I went back to sit, I fell rather rapidly
on my chair, as if I was tired of standing (though I did not feel so
tired that I couldn't stand up more, but it does seem like my body was
erring on the side of trying to conserve energy). I also noted that I
generally had more of a sitting affinity through the day, with a bit
less of a desire to get up. However, by around 11:30 PM, the situation
had improved, and I had no trouble finishing up post-meal cleanup and
cleaning the rice container once I did get up.

The next morning, when I woke up, I felt a bit tired at a level
comparable to what one might feel after returning from exercise --
except that I hadn't actually done any exercise. The qualia were a
little different than those of exercise, but the level of fatigue was
comparable.

### Light sensitivity

When I put the light on around 7:54 PM, I felt more light sensitivity
than usual (I generally have light sensitivty issues, but in the past
year they have generally been pretty mild, without any acute
manifestations and generally only starting to cause slight fatigue
after extended periods of time). I suspect this increased light
sensitivity was related to the fatigue and neck tightness after the
vaccine. Fortunately, the light sensitivity subsided quickly, and
didn't handicap me later that evening and at night.

### Tightness in the back of the neck

At 7:07 PM the day of the vaccine, I noticed slight tightness in the
back of the neck. It's not totally out of the ordinary to experience
this briefly even without a vaccine, so the role of the vaccine isn't
clear. The feeling subsided.

### Thirst

When I got back from the vaccine, I noticed I was way thirstier than
would be expected based on the temperature and the rest of my
exertion. I continued to be a little thirstier than usual through the
rest of the day, but not very notably so.

### Hunger

I noticed more hunger than usual (relative to the level of physical
activity and temperature) for my second meal on 2025-03-21 as well as
my first meal on 2025-03-22). The hunger also felt psychologically
different than usual; it wasn't the post-exertion hunger or the "Warm
up my body against the cold" hunger but the "it's safer to stock up
because I might need it for my fight" hunger.

### Urination

I did not notice any significant changes to urination on the day of
the vaccine. However, I did have an extra round of urination the next
morning, and it had the qualia of "there are toxins I need to dump
quickly".

### Temperature and thermal sensitivity

My temperature measurements taken the night of the vaccine
appointment, around 1:27 AM (10 hours after the vaccine) were normal,
in fact a bit on the low side (about 97 degrees Fahrenheit). I had no
subjective sensation of fever.

Overall, I would say my thermal sensitivity was about 2-3 degrees
Fahrenheit off from usual, i.e., I behaved as if it was about 2-3
degrees Fahrenheit colder than it actually was. A larger gap could
have led to chills, but this gap was small enough that at the ambient
temperatures it caused no issues.

### Sleep quality and quantity

My sleep duration seems to have gone up a little bit, particularly
considering that the weather has become warmer, which in general
should cause the sleep duration to reduce. This is likely explained
partly by reduced sleep quality on the first night after the vaccine,
as well as not sleeping extra on that night itself to compensate for
the poor quality.

Compared to an average duration of about 8 hours 10 minutes between
time of going to sleep and time of waking up, my durations were as
follows:

* 2025-03-21 (Friday) to 2025-03-22 (Saturday): 8 hours 20 minutes
  from 1:42 AM to 10:02 AM; this was the night of the vaccine and had
  comparatively poor sleep quality, though still better than after
  many vaccines and medical procedures.

* 2025-03-22 (Saturday) to 2025-03-23 (Sunday): 9 hours 7 minutes from
  1:08 AM to 10:15 AM.

* 2025-03-23 (Sunday) to 2025-03-24 (Monday): 8 hours 50 minutes from
  1:02 AM to 9:52 AM.

The duration of time I wake up for mid-sleep urination is about 9 to
12 minutes, and it stayed within that range for these three days as
well.

### Sore throat

I have had off-and-on sore throat for the past two weeks, initially
brought on by what I believe to be an excess of cayenne pepper, from
which I recovered, but then had some further ups and downs. I did
experience a slight resurgence in sore throat which might have been
influenced by the vaccine, but it's not clear either way.
