Sections of this document:

* [Appointment booking](#appointment-booking)

## Appointment booking

I booked my appointment for the COVID vaccine (indicating a preference
for Pfizer) on Saturday March 1. The appointment is for Friday March
21 at 3 PM at the 2801 Adeline Street location.

I followed the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
for the process. In particular, this included checking my calendar and
on-call schedule around the time, picking the recommended day of week
and time of day, and checking for other events in the two weeks before
and after. I also blocked off time on my calendar for the vaccine
appointment and did the other setup (including on-call changes and
calendar reminders) based on guidance in the best practices doc.

### Consent form

After booking the vaccine, I filled the consent form. The questions were as follows:

* Do you have a history of allergic reactions or allergies to latex,
  medications, food, or vaccines (e.g., polyethylene glycol,
  polysorbate, eggs, bovine protein, gelatin, gentamicin, polymyxin,
  neomycin, phenol, yeast, or thimerosal)?

  Answer: No

* Have you ever had a reaction after receiving a vaccination,
  including fainting or feeling dizzy?

  Answer: No

* Have you ever had a seizure disorder for which you are on seizure
  medication(s), a brain disorder, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (a
  condition that causes paralysis) or other nervous system problem?

  Answer: No

* Have you received any vaccinations or skin tests in the past eight weeks?

  Answer: No

* Check any vaccinations you've received in the past. Include a best estimate for the month(MM) and year(YYYY) of each vaccination.

  Pneumonia: did not check

  Shingles: did not check

  Whooping cough: checked, and entered 07/2024 for the [Tdap vaccine
  booster
  dose](../2024/2024-07-12-tdap-vaccine-booster-dose.md).

* Do you have any chronic health condition(s) such as cancer, chronic
  kidney disease, immunocompromised, chronic lung disease, obesity,
  sickle cell disease, diabetes, asthma or heart disease?

  Answer: No

* Have you been treated with antibody therapy (monoclonal antibodies
  or convalescent plasma) specifically for COVID-19?

  Answer: No

## Preparation

### Strength exercises and hand gripper exercise paused on 2025-03-19

On Wednesday 2025-03-19, I paused strength exercises and hand gripper
exercise. This was consistent with the calendar reminder I had put in
place.

### Weather check on the evening of 2025-03-19

On the evening of Wednesday 2025-03-19, I checked the weather and
confirmed that the time of the vaccine administration is forecast to
not have rain and to be reasonably warm (temperature range of 61-62
degrees Fahrenheit).

### Shopping and laundry done on 2025-03-19 and 2025-03-20

I did shopping at Berkeley Bowl on 2025-03-19 and at Trader Joe's on
2025-03-20. I did regular laundry on 2025-03-19 and heavy laundry on
2025-03-20, so my shopping and laundry needs in the days right after
the vaccine are minimal.

### Packing / prep on the morning of 2025-03-21

While packing / prep is ideally done the previous evening, the
previous evening was hectic with laundry completion, so I deferred
packing / prep to the morning. This included packing the COVID-19
vaccine card as well as looking into my California digital vaccine
record situation.
