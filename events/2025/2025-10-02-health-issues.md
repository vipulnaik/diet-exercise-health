# 2025-10-02: health issues

On Thursday 2025-10-02, I experienced a bunch of health issues.

## Events of the day (2025-10-02)

### Temperature drop in the morning and waking up a bit earlier (around 7:51 AM)

I woke up at 7:51 AM, about half an hour before my usual time of
waking up. The temperature was a bit lower than usual and it was more
humid, due to overnight rain. I was also feeling a little more tired,
but still felt like getting out of bed.

### Blood in stool and on wiping (around 8:30 AM)

I finished my bowel movement at around 8:30 AM.

When examining my stool after morning bowel movement (that seemed
pretty normal until that point), I noticed blood in the stool (red
coloration on part of the otherwise brown stool). I also noticed a
decent amount of blood on wiping; unlike tailbone bleeds, which happen
from time to time, the blood seemed to come from the entire length of
the anus. However, I didn''t experience pain during or after bowel
movement.

### Sudden onset of chills and malaise (11:45 AM)

After the stool, I had a normal and productive morning. I even did
at-home jogging, then was in a work meeting for about an hour.

It was at around 11:45 AM that I had a sudden onset of chills and a
general sense of malaise. The work meeting, fortunately, was getting
to a close. I wore my sweatshirt, which I normally wouldn't at that
indoor temperature (about 70 degrees Fahrenheit) though it was kind-of
borderline.

I quickly broke for a meal, even though the malaise made me less
hungry, because I expected that having a meal would help restore me.

As I was getting food out, I noticed my hands shaking a little bit,
sort of like shivering but not quite.

Things got better after my meal.

### Productive afternoon and evening

I had a productive afternoon and evening, including a pretty lengthy
trip for an administrative task and then to buy groceries. While I was
still feeling a bit of malaise when I started out on the trip, I felt
fine after a bit of walking.

I took my sweatshirt off after returning in the evening.

### Return of chills at night, plus tension headache (around 10 PM)

I was generally a little tired at night, and the chills started
returning at 10 PM (I did not have a sweatshirt on).

I also noticed a tension headache at the back of my head. This got a
little worse by the time I went to sleep at 11:25 PM.

### Fitful initial sleep (11:25 PM onward, for about 2 hours)

My initial sleep starting around 11:25 PM (when I went to sleep) was
very fitful, and there was a particular cognitive theme that my mind
kept looping on, though when I later woke up and tried to coherently
articulate the cognitive theme, I failed (so it was an incoherent
theme that did not really translate to words). I think it took me
about 2 hours to get to sleep.

## The next day (2025-10-03)

### Waking up to urinate

I got up to urinate at around 8:15 AM. At this point, I felt more
well-rested, but still had a bit of a tension headache.

I went back to sleep at 8:30 AM, with the intention of sleeping in.

### Waking up for real

I finally got out of bed at 10:07 AM after about 1.5 hours in a
semi-sleepy state. I still felt a bit tired and still had a bit of a
headache, but I did feel better.

### Mostly normal day

I had a mostly normal day.

I skipped all exercises so I could attend to time-sensitive stuff in
the morning (the delay in waking up meant I could not do the
time-sensitive stuff plus do exercise). But later in the day, I did a
package pick-up from the Amazon Hub Locker, and the journey back was a
fair amount of exercise, so I got my exercise and also confirmed that
my health was okay.

I went to sleep at 12:32 AM.

## Two days later (2025-10-04)

I woke up at 8:34 AM, getting a normal 8 hours of sleep at a
reasonably good quality. I also did my usual exercise in the
morning. Overall, as of this time I consider myself back to normal.

## Potential causal stories

There was no major smoking gun in the days leading up to
2025-10-02. But, there were a few contributors.

### A pattern of slightly delayed sleep without compensated slight delays in waking up

* grtcfs = getting ready to close for sleep
* cfs = closing for sleep
* wts = went to sleep
* wu = woke up

Night of | grtcfs time | cfs time | wts time | wu time (next morning)
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
2025-09-26 | 1:03 AM | 1:08 AM | 2:06 AM | 8:28 AM
2025-09-27 | 11:59 PM | 12:07 AM | 1:07 AM | 7:58 AM
2025-09-28 | 11:22 PM | 11:38 PM | 12:51 AM | 8:38 AM
2025-09-29 | 10:49 PM | 11:06 PM | 12:12 AM | 8:19 AM
2025-09-30 | 11:43 PM | 11:53 PM | 12:59 AM | 8:28 AM
2025-10-01 | 11:43 PM | 12:18 AM | 1:17 AM | 7:51 AM

The context here is that on the last Friday (2025-09-26) I learned
about potential in-person meetings the week of 2025-10-06. The plan
was tentative, but I determined that it would be a good idea to move
my sleep pattern to one of waking up earlier, so that I could more
easily accommodate the meetings.

In this context, I started on an effort to move my time of waking up
earlier.

However, whereas I didn't stay up too late, I ended up, on many days,
staying up about as late as I would have stayed up in a context where
I didn't have to wake up slightly earlier.

The net effect was not huge on any given day -- instead of sleeping
about 8 hours or more prior to my time of waking up, I was sleeping
about 7-7.5 hours prior to my intended time of waking up, and I was
getting out of bed a bit sooner than I would have if I wasn't trying
to adjust my sleep cycle. But doing this a few days in a row likely
created sleep pressure, and I didn't have any day in between where I
got a relaxed 8+ hours of sleep.

The proximal reasons for staying up that "little bit later" than
desired tended to be a mix of minor things coming up, or existing
things taking a bit longer to wrap up, primarily because I chose to
get them to a logical point and not leave threads hanging (where it
just cost me an extra 5-10 minutes). Monday and Tuesday of the week
had a bunch of time-sensitive stuff come up in the morning, which
means that some of the work I would normally do in the morning I ended
up having to delay till later in the day, which added up to push the
overflow into affecting my sleep time. Wednesday didn't have
time-sensitive stuff in the morning, but I did end up having some
overflow from Tuesday.

The broader, larger reason for these is that I have in general had a
huge time squeeze in Q3 2025, and many of the big items are finally
getting close to a logical conclusion, but I have a large number of
other items I have been deferring so I have a lot of temptation to
just sit down and do them, particularly if it feels (when I start)
that they will be 10 minutes or less.

Another thing to note is that the nights of both 2025-09-30 and
2025-10-01 ended only slightly more high-stimulation notes than usual
(for different reasons on both days). Though I feel I did ultimately
resolve things by the time of actually going to sleep, the level of
excitement for that late at night is not ideal.

### Weather changes

There was a sudden change to temperature and humidity on the morning
of 2025-10-02, thanks to overnight rain. My body may have reacted
poorly to the changes.

There may have also been a drop in temperature in the morning after I
woke up, something my body may not have been expecting, and that might
have contributed to the chills.
