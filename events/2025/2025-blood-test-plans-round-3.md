# 2025 blood test plans: round 3

As of 2025-11-12, I'm not sure whether I will get a third round of
blood tests in 2025. If I don't, this list is still expected to be
useful for whenever I next get tested in 2026.

Prices were not double-checked so they may be out-of-date.

## Tests

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/test/0ff7bca6-cfbc-49d9-bc93-40f6f7059dec ($10)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/collections/lab-builder/products/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp ($12)
* https://requestatest.com/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

This is one of those "throw it in whenever you get a blood test"
panels.

### Lipid panel

Test details:

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/lipid-panel-total-cholesterol-hdl-ldl-vldl-triglycerides-hdl-ldl-ratio ($12)

This is to see the effect of recently added amla supplementation on
LDL cholesterol.

### Apo B

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/test/053fa95b-6263-4f4c-8780-0ee4ca08a284 ($17.20)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/apolipoprotein-b-apob ($28)
* https://requestatest.com/apolipoprotein-b-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $65)

This is to see the effect of recently added amla supplementation on
Apo B.

### FSH and LH

This is more as an initial measurement. I still want to think about
whether it makes sense to also get testosterone again alongside these,
and whether to defer all of these to a later date. This may be
influenced by how I use the information.

### Creatine

* https://requestatest.com/creatine-blood-test (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $89)

The goal is to get additional data to inform the analysis of creatine
supplementation I started.

### Thyroid panel

A redo of a test done in December 2024, but now with TBG added.

### Thyroid binding globulin (TBG)

This is to complement the thyroid panel and give more context to the T3 index.

### OxLDL

I need to consider whether this might or might not be useful.

### ADMA/SDMA

I need to consider whether this might or might not be useful.

### Apo A1

I've ignored this so far as it doesn't seem relevant to cardiovascular
health, but there's recent evidence suggesting it is relevant to
neurodegenerative disease (Apo A1 apoprotein -- not lipoprotein -- is
small enough to cross the blood brain barrier and may be
neuroprotective).

### Omega-3 index

This time, I should follow the protocol of not pausing omega-3
supplementation (what about other supplementation? Depends on what
other tests I am doing).

### B12, MMA, and homocysteine

To be fleshed out later.
