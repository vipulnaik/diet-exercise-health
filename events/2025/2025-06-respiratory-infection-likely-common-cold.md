# 2025-06: respiratory infection (likely common cold)

I appear to have gotten a respiratory infection, likely the common
cold, probably as a result of being exposed to it during my return
journey from Bengaluru to San Francisco that included a lengthy
international flight.

Here is a timeline:

* Friday 2025-06-06 and Saturday 2025-06-07: This was my period of
  travel from Bengaluru to San Francisco. I masked for most of the
  journey (with brief breaks in between to recharge myself) which in
  theory should have reduced the viral load compared to the
  counterfactual, but I expect the cumulative exposure would still
  have been high.

* Saturday 2025-06-07 and Sunday 2025-06-08: I did not observe any
  symptoms of respiratory infection.

* Overnight / morning of Monday 2025-06-09: I observed a sore throat,
  which was my first clear symptom, plus slight chills and subjective
  temperature being 2 to 3 degrees Celsius lower than normal. However,
  my energy levels were close to normal otherwise.

* Tuesday 2025-06-10: I started experienced transient aches similar to
  those I had experienced after the COVID vaccine. I noticed
  lower-than-usual SpO2 values indicating potential congestion (one
  reading of 85-92%, second reading more normal at 95-96%; see
  [pulse_oximeter_readings.sql](../../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql)). I
  took an at-home COVID test and for a negative result
  ([details](2025-06-10-walgreens-covid-test.md)). I took an extra
  n-acetylcysteine (so I took two 600 mg instead of just one) and
  after that (perhaps caused by it) had more of a runny nose.

  I slept from 3:50 PM to 2:11 AM the next day, with a brief period of waking up in between.

* Wednesday 2025-06-11: I had a runny nose, needing to blow my nose
  about 2 to 3 times an hour, plus sneezing about 1 to 3 times an
  hour. The soreness in the throat had reduced. I took a double dose
  of n-acetylcysteine again. My pulse oximeter reading was 94-96%.

## Diagnosis: likely common cold

The symptoms pretty clearly fit a respiratory infection, and the
timeline suggests that the flight is how I got it.

I'm not sure what kind of respiratory infection it is. As of Wednesday
2025-06-11, after finally experiencing a runny nose, I am inclined in
favor of the common cold as opposed to COVID and the flu. Some of the
reasons:

* The symptom pattern also matches the common cold more than the flu
  or COVID; see
  [here](https://pharmacy.msu.edu/resources/how-to-tell-cold-and-flu-symptoms-apart). For
  instance:

  * My symptom onset was gradual, as opposed to sudden for the flu.

  * I didn't have a fever; fever is rare for the common cold but
    normal for the flu and COIVD.

  * I had runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and (occasional) cough --
    all symptoms that are comomn in the common cold and sometimes /
    rare for flu and COVID.

* I got a negative result for the COVID test. I also got a COVID
  vaccine recently on 2025-03-21 (see
  [here](2025-03-21-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md)).

* I also got a flu vaccine on 2024-10-25, about 7.5 months ago (see
  [here](../2024/2024-10-25-flu-shot.md)).
