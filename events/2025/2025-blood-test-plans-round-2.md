# 2025 blood test plans: round 2

## Booking process

### Order (placed 2025-03-30)

Based on a review of prices and availability, I decided to order the
serum creatine from Request A Test (LabCorp: $39) and order the rest
of the tests from Marek Diagnostics for a total of $292 (it looks like
Marek Diagnostics no longer has the $5 phlebotomist fee). I was also
able to apply a discount code and get 15% off the $292, so I ended up
paying only $248.20 for Marek Diagnostics.

Prior to placing both orders, I verified that the LabCorp location at
3100 San Pablo Ave is still open. The one at 3000 Colby St is still
"temporarily" closed. For Request A Test, I needed to specify a
desired lab location and used the 3100 San Pablo Ave one.

I placed both orders on Sunday 2025-03-30 around 11 PM.

### Appointment / blood draw date (undecided)

As of Sunday 2025-03-30, I am as yet undecided regarding whether to do
a walk-in in early April, book an appointment for around mid-April, or
delay the testing to late June or July (late April to mid-June are
infeasible for various reasons). I need to review my overall workload
and various pros and cons. The reason I placed the order despite this
uncertainty was two-fold: to benefit from the 15% discount that was
available till 2025-03-31, and to place the order and have the
requisition form(s) printed and ready to go to give myself maximum
flexibility to get the tests at the most convenient time without much
lag.

## Tests around lipids, insulin resistance, and diabetic tendencies

### Enhanced lipid panel

Test details:

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/enhanced-lipid-panel-lipids-apob-glyca-dri ($50 as a package; it would be $61 if I ordered the tests individually)
* Own Your Labs does not have this bundle, but the pieces other than Diabetes Risk Index total to $59.20
* Request A Test doesn't seem to have GlycA and Diabetes Risk Index; the other two pieces cost $93 on LabCorp and $101 on Quest Diagnostics

This particular package is only available on Marek Diagnostics. It
includes lipid panel, Apo B, GlycA, and DRI. Of these, lipid panel and
Apo B are things I'd like to test regularly, while GlycA and DRI are
things I would like to get an occasional benchmark of. The individual
tests are $10 for the lipid panel and $17 each for the rest, totaling
to $61, so ordering the combo is better. Ordering the individual tests
on Own Your Labs or Request A Test is also more expensive.

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details:

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/collections/lab-builder/products/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp ($10)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/comp-metabolic-panel-14/ ($10)
* https://requestatest.com/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

I'd like to get a comprehensive metabolic panel, primarily for the
glucose reading that I can then view in conjunction with HbA1c and
insulin readings.

### Insulin

Test details:

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/insulin ($15)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/insulin/ ($14.40)
* https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

This should be measured along with CMP to get a measure of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) by combining insulin and glucose.

### HbA1c

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/hba1c-hemoglobin-a1c ($9)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/hemoglobin-a1c/ ($8.80)
* https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $39)

This should be done in conjunction with a CMP so that the glucose and
HbA1c can be compared.

## Tests for hormone levels

### Total testosterone (LC/MS)

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/total-testosterone-lc-ms ($42)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/testosterone-total-lc-ms-ms/ ($57.01)
* https://requestatest.com/testosterone-bioavailable-free-and-weakly-bound-with-total-testosterone-lc/ms-test (LabCorp $139, Quest Diagnostics $169, but this also includes the SHBG and albumin part

LC/MS is more accurate than the other methods.

It's not worth getting free testosterone (a more expensive assay) as
that's unlikely to be accurate anyway. By combining with SHBG and
albumin (see next subsection) we can estimate free testosterone.

### Sex hormone binding globulin

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/sex-hormone-binding-globulin-shbg ($40)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/sex-hormone-binding-globulin/ ($41.60)
* Request A Test we can just use the bundle for bioavailable testosterone, see above

Can be combined with total testosterone and albumin (part of CMP)
using an online calculator such as
[this](https://www.mdapp.co/free-and-bioavailable-testosterone-calculator-544/)
to estimate free testosterone.

## Tests of markers around inflammation and endothelial dysfunction that are particularly relevant for atherosclerotic risk

### Complete blood count (CBC) with differential

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/complete-blood-count-cbc-with-nlr-differential-and-platelets ($10)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/cbc-with-differential-platelet/ ($8.40)
* https://requestatest.com/cbc-with-differential-testing (LabCorp: $29; Quest Diagnostics: $35)

Done in round 1 for 2025, with normal results. I'd like to do this
again in round 2 to get more data points and be able to identify
concerning trends.

### C-reactive protein (high-sensitivity) as an inflammatory marker relevant to atherosclerosis

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-hs-crp ($23)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/c-reactive-protein-cardiac/ ($26.40)
* https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

Done in round 1 for 2025, with normal results. I'd like to do this
again in round 2 to get more data points and be able to identify
concerning trends. My expectation is that if round 2 comes back normal
as well, the frequency going forward will be 1 to 2 times a year
instead of 2 to 4 times a year.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate-esr-westergren ($10)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/sedimentation-rate-westergren/ ($13.60)
* https://requestatest.com/sedimentation-rate-modified-westergren-testing (LabCorp $29; Quest Diagnostics: $29)

This is a marker of systemic inflammation, albeit one that moves a bit
more slowly than CRP, so whereas CRP is good for reacting quickly to
acute inflammation, ESR moves more slowly over a 7-day period. I don't
think it adds a lot of value over CRP, but I want to test this at
least once just to see if there's anything concerning about it.

### Ferritin

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/ferritin ($10)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/ferritin-serum/ ($15.01)
* https://requestatest.com/ferritin-blood-test (LabCorp $29; Quest Diagnostics: $29)

Like CRP and ESR, this is a marker of systemic inflammation. I want to
get a baseline measurement but I don't expect to be testing this often
in the future.

### Serum vitamin A

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/vitamin-a-serum ($38)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/vitamin-a-serum/ ($56)
* https://requestatest.com/vitamin-a-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $69)

### Serum magnesium

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/magnesium ($10)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/magnesium-serum/ ($30.24)
* https://requestatest.com/magnesium-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

### RBC magnesium

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/magnesium-rbc-icp-ms ($25)
* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/magnesium-rbc/ ($37.20)
* https://requestatest.com/magnesium-rbc-testing (LabCorp: $49; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

This is considered a more superior proxy than serum magnesium for the
body's magnesium status, insofar as it is a measure of an
intracellular form of magnesium.

### Serum creatine

* Not available on Marek Diagnostics
* Not available on Own Your Labs
* https://requestatest.com/creatine-blood-test (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $89)
