# 2025-11-26: turmeric supplement purchase

On Wednesday 2025-11-26, I purchased a bottle of [turmeric
supplement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018GPDCV4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
(this includes turmeric and black pepper).

On Tuesday 2025-12-09, I picked up the order from the Amazon Hub Locker.

On Wednesday 2025-12-10, I tried out the supplement.

My plan as of this time is to take about one capsule a day, which is a
safe amount (about 767 mg) compared to the three that are
recommended. This is because I already have a reasonably large amount
of dietary turmeric. The supplement has the benefit of being
concentrated and including black pepper.

However, I might increase the supplement dose when I am feeling more
inflamed or unwell. I might also reduce the dose to about once every
two days. The bottle expires in about three years, giving me the
flexibility to consume more slowly.
