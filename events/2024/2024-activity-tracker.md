# 2024 activity tracker

This continues with the spirit of my [2023 activity
tracker](2023-activity-tracker.md), recording my trips outside the
home. I exclude trips for jogging and running. I also exclude trips
for grocery purchases and picking up takeout from restaurants; you can
get a sense for those trips by looking in
[food_purchases.sql](../../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Friday January 12

In the afternoon, I made a trip, mostly for my COVID-19 vaccine.

I first went to the Ashby BART to add money to my Clipper Card. This
wasn't urgent, but I had a few minutes before my COVID-19 vaccine
appointment at Walgreens, and I wanted to add more money to my Clipper
Card to get the item off my list prior to upcoming international
travel (BART cost for airport trip is high, and there may be other
travel needed in preparation for the trip).

I was done there at around 2:36 PM. From there, I went to the
Walgreens on Adeline Street, arriving at 2:45 PM. My process of
getting the COVID-19 vaccine is described in the [appointment section
of the doc on that
topic](2024-01-12-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md#appointment-2024-01-12). After
I was done with the vaccine card update, I bought a few items from
Walgreens, checked out, and headed back home.

## Thursday January 18

## Friday January 26

## Thursday February 15

In the afternoon, I made a trip for administrative stuff. I was out
from around 1:30 PM to around 2:30 PM.

Over this period, I was on a flight from San Francisco to Bengaluru. I
arrived in Bengaluru on Sunday and then went over to stay at my
parents' place.

## Monday February 19

On this day, in the morning, I went for a brief administrative trip.

## Sunday March 3 and Monday March 4

On these two days, I was busy with a bureaucratic trip to Chennai. The
trip was for my US visa interview at the US consulate in Chennai. The
interview itself was a walkin 221(g) interview. I went for the
interview around 8:30 AM and was back a little after 10 AM.

## Monday March 11

## Tuesday March 12

In the late morning / early afternoon, I went out with my parents for
lunch.

## Friday March 15 and Saturday March 16

Over this period, I flew back from Bengaluru to San Francisco.

## Monday March 18

In the afternoon, I went to the Amazon Hub Locker at ASUC Berkeley to
pick up a bunch of stuff. This was an order I had placed to replace
the stuff that I left behind in India -- with this one-time investment
I expect the load of stuff I have to carry back-and-forth to be
significantly less in the future.

Since there was a lot of stuff to pick up, I carried my suitcase
along, and indeed I needed to pack it 50-75% full for the return
journey, along with putting a few smaller items in my bagpack.

As I did not want to dirty the suitcase wheels on the uneven city
sidewalks (I'm trying to restrict wheel use to smooth indoor surfaces
such as those at home or in airports), I carried the suitcase both
ways. This was not too difficult going to the place, because the
weight was only the weight of the suitcase. However, for the return
journey, the weight was quite a bit, and the process of coming home
was slow. For the return journey, I did need to put the suitcase down
for a few seconds a few times, so it did make contact with thecity
sidewalks, but I didn't make the wheels roll over the sidewalks.

When I got back home, and before I started unpacking,I weighed the
suitcase and got a weight of around 9.1-9.3 kg.

## Wednesday March 20

In the evening (starting a little after 4 PM) I went out for a
combination of a bureaucratic trip and food purchases. The
bureaucratic portion of the trip ended shortly after 6 PM. After that,
I did food purchases recorded in
[food_purchases.sql](../../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Friday March 22

In the morning I made a bureaucratic trip. The trip involved walking
about 45 minutes each way and about 15 minutes at the location.

Around 10 minutes into the return trip, I experienced mild shoulder
pain in my right shoulder. I was carrying my bagpack on my shoulders
but the load on it was minimal. The shoulder pain continued in mild
form though it was alleviated by taking the bagpack partly off my
right shoulder. The pain largely subsided after I got home and removed
my bagpack.

## Wednesday March 27

From around noon to 5:45 PM, I made a trip to the WeWork at 1111
Broadway Street in Oakland to hang out with work colleagues. As part
of the trip, we ate out at Tay Ho Restaurant in Oakland, where I had a
vegan braised eggplant with tofu and mushroom.

## Thursday March 28

In the late afternoon / early evening, I went to the Amazon Hub Locker
for package pickup. I took my suitcase along; even though the total
amount of stuff wasn't a lot, there were a few larger items that would
be easier to carry in the suitcase rather than in my bagpack or in
grocery bags.

Indeed, I filled the suitcase about 25-30%.

As I did not want to dirty the suitcase wheels on the uneven city
sidewalks (I'm trying to restrict wheel use to smooth indoor surfaces
such as those at home or in airports), I carried the suitcase both
ways. This was not too difficult going to the place; it was a little
harder during the return journey as the suitcase was heavier; however,
it was nowhere near as hard as for my Monday March 18 trip.

After I returned home, I immediately went out again with my bagpack to
shop at Walgreens (I left the suitcase at home).

## Monday April 1

purchases at Trader Joe's as recorded in

pretty heavy to carry back, so it ended up being good strength
training as well.

strength exercise as well as aerobic exercise, partly making up for my
skipping jogging in the morning.
