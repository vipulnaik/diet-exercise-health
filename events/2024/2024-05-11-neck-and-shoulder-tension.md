# 2024-05-11: neck and shoulder tension

## 2024-05-11

In the morning, I experienced slight tension on my neck/shoulder on
the right side back. Later in the day, the tension increased a little
bit, and I also experienced a smaller amount of tension on the left
side. Later at night, the tension on both sides was almost equal. The
tension didn't get much in the way of my work. Massaging the area did
seem to give some relief in the short term.

My suspicion is that this has to do with straining myself while
sleep. It could also have to do with carrying large amounts of laundry
the previous day.

While still in bed in the morning, I paid more attention to the pain
and used the pillow to relax my neck and shoulder before waking up.

Although I still had slight neck and shoulder tension, it was much
less than the previous day.

In the afternoon, I went to pick up a package from the Amazon Hub
locker. On the way, I bought some rice. Toward the end (last 5 minutes
walking) of the trip, walking for about 1.5 hours, I felt a clear pain
in my right shoulder. Taking the right side of the backpack off my
shoulder onto my right arm helped. Once I got back and took the
backpack off, the pain subsided to its earlier level.
