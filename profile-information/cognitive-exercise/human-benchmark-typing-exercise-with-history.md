# Human Benchmark typing exercise (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exericse

### Functional relevance

Typing is an activity I do a lot of, and I expect that being faster at
typing will help me get things done a little bit faster. It's the
binding constraint for only some of the things I do, but helping even
with that limited subset will save me time.

### The goal is to maintain above 90 wpm and keep trying to improve (till at least 150 wpm)

My general sense is that around 70-80 wpm is good for most tasks that
involve a little bit of typing here and there (for instance, SQL data
entry, coding, etc.), but for writing that involves writing a
paragraph or longer, 90 wpm is better, and even going up to 150 wpm
will result in speed improvements. I am consistently above 90 wpm, so
my goal is to at least maintain that, but to try to keep improving at
least until I get to 150 wpm.

### Single-handed variant

I occasionally do single-handed typing. This is not part of my regular
typing practice but a monthly thing I do to make sure that I can type
reasonably fast with a single hand. This is because typing is
important to me, so I want to make sure I can continue to do so even
if one of my hands becomes injured or immobile.

This document does not include details of single-handed
typing. Roughly, my goal with single-handed typing is to be above 40
wpm with my left hand and above 30 wpm with my right hand. In
practice, I am around 45-60 wpm with my left hand and around 30-45 wpm
with my right hand.

## Current protocol and status as of 2024-11-20

My goal is to play about 1-3 times a week.

## Peformance history

* 2024-05-16: 94 wpm, averaging two data points of 85 wpm and 102 wpm
  respectively. This places me at the 94.1th percentile. I have had
  previous practice with this test (before logging in) and obviously
  have a lot of practice typing in real life.

* 2024-09-21: 95 wpm moving average, placing me at the 94.1th
  percentile. The score values range from 70 wpm to 110 wpm.

* 2024-10-15: 102 wpm moving average, placing me at the 97.2th
  percentile. My scores are generally in the 95-110 wpm range with
  occasional dips down to the 80s.

* 2024-11-20: 94 wpm moving average, placing me at the 94.1th
  percentile. Recent scores have been a little lower, which might be
  due to the colder conditions making it a little harder to type fast
  and accurately.

* 2025-01-16: 97 wpm moving average, placing me at the 94.12the
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2024-11-20.
