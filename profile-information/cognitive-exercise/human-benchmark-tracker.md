# Human Benchmark tracker

This document is for notes on my performance on [human benchmark
tests](https://humanbenchmark.com/). I don't record all scores, just
summaries of my recent and cumulative trends periodically.

The following exercises have their own pages and have been removed
from this summary. Eventually all exercises should have their own
page:

* [Sequence memory](human-bechmark-sequence-memory-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Verbal memory](human-benchmark-verbal-memory-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Number memory](human-benchmark-number-memory-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Chimp test](human-benchmark-chimp-test-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Typing](human-benchmark-typing-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Reaction time](human-benchmark-reaction-time-exercise-with-history.md)

## 2024-09-21

* Visual memory: 9 points moving average over very few attempts,
  placing me at the 5.0th percentile. I am planning to do a lot of
  practice of this and move up to a consistently higher score.

## 2024-10-15

I've been doing more regular practice, and appear to have improved
quite a bit:

* Visual memory: 10.8 points moving average, placing me at the 40.5th
  percentile. The score distribution on the whole has 9 and 10 as
  modal values. I usually get to level 10 but only occasionally get
  past it to level 11. Very occasionally I fail to get to level 10. My
  highest level ever is 13, which may have been due to getting lucky
  with some patterns.

* Aim trainer: 721 ms, placing me at the 4.3th percentile. I expect to
  improve a little bit here with more practice, to at least get past
  the percentile for reaction time.

## 2025-02-18

* Visual memory: 10.2 points moving average, placing me at the 40.53th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2024-10-15.

* Aim trainer: 705 ms moving average, placing me at the 4.34th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2024-10-15.

## 2025-05-21

* Visual memory: 11.0 points moving average, placing me at the 40.53th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2025-02-18.

* Aim trainer: 713 ms moving average, placing me at the 4.34th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2025-02-18.
