# Human Benchmark number memory exercise with history

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance

The number memory exercise measures my ability to memorize a raw
sequence of information quickly, with a limited amout of time. It's
sequential memory, with numeric tokens, but unlike the sequence memory
exercise, I have to memorize the whole thing in one round rather than
building it up gradually.

The 6-digit version of this is what I do when I memorize an OTP and
enter it.

### Relation with forward digit span

This is a little different from forward digit span (FDS). With FDS,
the sequence is read out digit by digit, with no ability to go back
and review. Here, the whole sequence is shown for a few seconds, so
there is opportunity to review.

### The goal is to get to a number memory of around 20 or higher

A number memory of around 20 or higher will be good enough for my
purposes.

## Current protocol and status as of 2024-11-17

My goal is to play about once every 1 or 2 weeks, at a suitable time
when I have at least 10 minutes to spare.

## Performance history

* 2024-05-16: 14.0 points, with just one play at 14.0 points. This
  places me at the 96.2th percentile. Although I had not had recent
  practice of this test, it does mimic a lot of real-world stuff
  (notably, remembering 2FA tokens for data entry) so I think I do
  have prior practice of this in some sense.

* 2024-09-21: 13.6 points moving average, placing me at the 96.2th
  percentle. My score ranges between 13 and 15.

* 2024-10-15: 13.6 points moving average, placing me at the 96.2th
  percentle. My score ranges between 13 and 15. There's no update
  since last month.

* 2024-11-17: 15.0 points moving average, placing me at the 97.7th
  percentile. My score ranges between 14 and 17.
