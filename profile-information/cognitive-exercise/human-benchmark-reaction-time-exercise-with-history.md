# Human Benchmark reaction time exercise with history

Exercise link: https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime

Some other exercises that I am considering doing for variety:

* https://cpstest.org/reaction-time-test/ (test of visual reaction + movement, but with more distractions on screen)
* https://playback.fm/audio-reaction-time (test of auditory reaction + movement)

The slightly different nature of these tests makes them a bit hard to
compare against each other, so it's more helpful to look at trends
*within* each test.

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance

The "reaction time" as measured by these tests, is actually a sum of two things:

* Stimulus reaction time, which is the time for the brain to process
  and decide to react to a stimulus. The stimulus could be visual,
  auditory, or tactile. The Human Benchmark reaction time test uses a
  visual stimulus, and more specifically, a simple color change. The
  reaction time can vary based on the type of stimulus (visual versus
  auditory versus tactile), its complexity (for instance, simple color
  change of a large area versus a small pattern emerging on screen),
  and the presence of distractions (with distractions of the same
  stimulus type as the stimulus being the most disruptive -- for
  instance, visual distractions in case of a visual stimulus).

* Movement time, which is the time taken from the brain deciding to
  make a movement, to actually making a movement. The movement in
  question here is the "click" action.

Some more technical sources only consider stimulus reaction time as
reaction time, but the reaction time as measured by Human Benchmark is
the sum of the two.

With both reaction time and movement time, generally speaking, the
lower the better. A low reaction time offers a bunch of benefits:

* Reaction time + movement time: It's good for reacting quickly to
  situations, which can help me catch myself and prevent
  accidents. This could include cases of falling, dropping something,
  stopping myself from accidentally clicking a button.

* Reaction time only: There's a theory that says that more complex
  thinking breaks down into a lot of individual reactions, so speeding
  up reaction time can increase the underlying speed for more complex
  thinking, holding everything else constant. Note that this
  particular benefit is specific to the reaction time component only,
  because movement time doesn't happen at each stage but only at the
  end.

### The goal is to practice daily and continue to improve, with < 200 ms as a decent stable value and about 150 ms as ideal

Based on my online reading (see for instance
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPSAimTrainer/comments/t5gn8h/comment/hzd8bco/)
and other answers to that question), it looks like regular daily
practice is important for improving (reaction time + movement
time). Further, my understanding is that most of the initial
improvement is on the movement time piece, but the reaction time to
the specific stimulus can also improve over time. My goal is to do
this daily practice.

Early evidence on 2025-02-25 after about a week of practice already
shows that performance can improve. When I started, my individual
scores were in the range of 250 to 300 ms. After a few days of
practice, my scores are in the range of 200 to 250 ms with occasional
higher scores in the range of 250 to 300 ms; however, when I am
fatigued, or in the presence of distractions, my score range does go
back up to the 250 to 300 ms range.

## Performance history

* 2024-10-15: 303 ms, placing me at the 7.3th percentile. This seems
  very hard to improve. I rarely get reaction times less than 230 ms,
  even in the best of times.

* 2025-02-18: 276 ms moving average, placing me at at 11.31th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2024-10-15.

* 2025-02-21 (after I started getting more serious about it and did
  several rounds of practice): 248 ms moving average, placing me at
  the 32.89th percentile. I think I'm getting the knack of this more
  and hope to improve a bit more with practice.
