# Human Benchmark verbal memory exercise with history

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance

The verbal memory exercise basically helps sharpen memory of the form
"have I seen this before?" when exposed to a whirlwind of new
stuff. Unlike sequence memory, it's not about remembering the exact
sequence in which things occurred. Also unlike sequence memory, the
dimensionality is huge; the tokens to remember are not from a small
set (digits) but a very large set (words, including some words I don't
even know).

Being good at verbal memory can help with keeping up with a bunch of
logically unconnected information.

### The goal is to build toward an average verbal memory exercise score of over 150

On a good run (generally a first run of the exercise if I am lucky) I
score in the range of 150 to 200. My goal is to more consistently
score in that range (or higher) in the first run. Relatedly, I'd like
to be very consistent about getting past 50 without making any
mistakes. I also aim to achieve these goals while doing at least 10
words per minute. Going very slow (for instance, 4-6 words per minute)
can help improve scores, but means that a single run of the game can
take a very long time.

As of 2024-10-17, when assembling this document, my moving average
score is 119.4 points, which averages out a huge variation in
scores. Unlike sequence memory, verbal memory is harder to score
highly on *consistently*, unless I go really slow (which I am trying
not to, with a speed of at least 10 words per minute).

As I'm not yet at the level I want to reach, my plan is to continue to
play the game a few times a week and build toward the level.

## Current protocol and status as of 2024-10-17

My goal is to play about three times a week, generally at a time where
I have at least ten minutes to spare. I should only play one round at
a given time, as multiple rounds can tend to lead to words getting
muddled up. It's also ideal to not play on successive days.

What times should I choose? In the morning, before starting or after
returning from exercise, on days when I am doing strength
exercises. However, if schedules are tight in the morning, then later
in the day, for instance, in the evening, after my
1-hour-notice-to-sleep time.

## Performance history

* 2024-05-16: 66.5 points, averaging 65 points and 68 points. This
  places me at the 77.72th percentile. Unlike the typing and sequence
  memory tests, I have not yet had practice with this test prior to
  these two plays.

* 2024-09-21: 118.4 points moving average, placing me at the 95.0th
  percentile. My historical score range is between 40 and 160, but
  recent results have been on the higher end. This may be a case of a
  game where I have improved in game-specific ways.

* 2024-10-15: 144.0 points moving average, placing me at the 97.9th
  percentile. My score can vary quite a bit, with 50 on the low end
  and 216 as my highest score. Generally, scores around 150-200 are
  what I can achieve when paying full attention (no distraction) and
  if I don't make a careless error.

* 2024-11-20: 131.0 points moving average, placing me at the 97.2th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since 2024-10-15. The
  variation in my scores, on both the upper and lower end, may have
  reduced somewhat.

* 2025-01-16: 154.6 points moving average, placing me at the 98.34th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last
  update on 2024-11-20.
