# Incentive spirometry (with history)

## 2025-05-20: experimentation with flow rate incentive spirometer in India

On Tuesday 2025-05-20, I experimented with a flow rate incentive
spirometer at my parents' home in India. The incentive spirometer is
something I have been thinking of getting, so I tried it out to get a
better sense.

The incentive spirometer I tried was [this
one](https://www.amazon.in/Control-Spirometer-Exerciser-Respiratory-Respirometer/dp/B08G1H9RWR). It
had 600 cc/second, 900 cc/second, and 1200 cc/second balls.

I tried the incentive spirometer a few times. After the first try, I
was consistently able to get the 600 cc/second and 900 cc/second
pulled to the top. For the 1200 cc/second, I was initially not able to
move it at all. Later, I found that I was sometimes able to move it to
the top late in my inbreath cycle, when my cheeks were pulled in as
well by the vacuum. Even after discovering this, I was not able to
raise the 1200 cc consistently, and it was hard to do this on multiple
consecutive inbreaths.
