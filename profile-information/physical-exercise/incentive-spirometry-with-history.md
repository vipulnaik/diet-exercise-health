# Incentive spirometry (with history)

## 2025-05-20: experimentation with flow rate incentive spirometer in India

On Tuesday 2025-05-20, I experimented with a flow rate incentive
spirometer at my parents' home in India. The incentive spirometer is
something I have been thinking of getting, so I tried it out to get a
better sense.

The incentive spirometer I tried was [this
one](https://www.amazon.in/Control-Spirometer-Exerciser-Respiratory-Respirometer/dp/B08G1H9RWR). It
had 600 cc/second, 900 cc/second, and 1200 cc/second balls.

I tried the incentive spirometer a few times. After the first try, I
was consistently able to get the 600 cc/second and 900 cc/second
pulled to the top. For the 1200 cc/second, I was initially not able to
move it at all. Later, I found that I was sometimes able to move it to
the top late in my inbreath cycle, when my cheeks were pulled in as
well by the vacuum. Even after discovering this, I was not able to
raise the 1200 cc consistently, and it was hard to do this on multiple
consecutive inbreaths.

## 2025-12-20: opening, washing, and first use of incentive spirometer in Berkeley

I had purchased on 2025-07-06 the [Willnice training
device](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWJL4ZQ9) after returning to
Berkeley but had not had time to open and set it up immediately after
purchase. On 2025-12-20, I finally got around to opening and washing
the device. After it had dried, I tried using it.

I made sure to only breathe in and not breathe out into the device.

I was able to get the 1200 cc / second ball up consistently (so all
three balls went up) but was not able to hold them in the up position
for longer than 1 second. This contrasts with the 5-6 seconds I had
been able to manage in India. I don't know how much of this difference
stems from the device being different (visually it looks the same)
versus my practice time being shortly after my meal, versus maybe the
device still being somewhat moist from the washing.

I'll be recording further practice rounds in my Slack self-chat logs,
so I should be able to assess the situation better over time.
