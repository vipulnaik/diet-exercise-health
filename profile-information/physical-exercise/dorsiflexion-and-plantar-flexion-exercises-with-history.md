# Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion exercises (with history)

Starting 2025-07-05, I began a practice of regular testing for
my angle of dorsiflexion and angle of plantar flexion.

## Functional relevance and goals of exercise

### Relevant to foot health and walking and running ability

Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are both important elements of the
gait cycle and in general for foot balance and mobility. However, it's
possible to gradually lose these and not really notice with regular
walking and running by compensating in other ways functionally, that
may create problems down the road. The goal of these exercises is to
monitor and get enough time to address issues.

### Verify and maintain decent angles of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of at least 35 degrees each

The goal of the exercise is two-fold: first, it helps verify that I
have decent dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, and provides early
warning signs if not. Second, the case of trying to measure indirectly
helps me exercise enough to maintain the angle and combat any slight
natural decay.

## Protocol

Rather than directly measuring the angle, I measured the horizontal
length that is my foot length times the cosine of the angle. Moreover,
rather than measure it exactly, I compare it against the length of a
known piece of furniture to obtain a quick upper bound on this
length. The reference length would yield an angle of about 40 degrees,
so by being able to achieve at or below the reference length, I
confirm that my angles of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are at
least about 40 degrees. After accounting for measurement error, this
confirms that the angles are over 35 degrees. This is a reasonable
angle.

## Triggers for overall exercise

I skip strength exercises about once every 3 days. On the alternating
days among days that I skip strength exercise, I do this exercise
along with other eyes-open balance and flexibility exercises. The
effective frequency is therefore about once every 6 days.

The other exercises I do along with this are
[standing-on-one-leg-toes-with-eyes-open](standing-on-one-leg-toes-with-eyes-open-with-history.md)
and
[standing-on-heels-with-eyes-open](standing-on-heels-with-eyes-open-with-history.md).
