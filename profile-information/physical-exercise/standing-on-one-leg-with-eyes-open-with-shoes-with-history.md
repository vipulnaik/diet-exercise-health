# Standing on one leg with eyes open (with shoes) (with history)

This is a "with shoes" variant of [standing on one leg with eyes
open](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-open-with-history.md).

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance and distinction from the normal at-home version without shoes

My standard standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-open exercise is done at
home without shoes.

The "with shoes" variant has very similar benefits, but with a few
differences:

* It's somewhat harder than without shoes (at least for the kind of
  shoes I wear, which are far from barefoot). The main challenge is
  the lack of simultaneous ground contact of the heel and toes. The
  toes are particularly important for both gripping and feeling the
  floor, but when flat on my heel, they are not pressed against the
  ground.

  With that said, the with/without shoes gap is less than it is for
  [standing on one leg with eyes
  closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-shoes-with-history.md). The
  difference likely stems from the fact that with my eyes open, I have
  enough visual input to compensate for the lack of direct tactile
  input from the feet. In general, eyes-open exercises are more
  bottlenecked on strength than on balance, and shoes don't impose a
  penalty on strength.

* It may be more functionally relevant to maintaining balance when
  wearing shoes, which is all my time outdoors (and where both the
  risk and the potential damage of injury are greater).

### Build to / maintain consistent standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-open with shoes on for about 2 minutes

About 2 minutes with shoes on is reasonable, and I both doubt I'll
need more, and think the time cost of longer stretches is high (since
I generally cannot multiplex this time with other useful stuff).

I appear to already be at this level for the right leg. As of
2025-11-29, I haven't done enough testing on the left leg to know if I
am already at this level for the left leg.

## Protocol

I should do this exercise whenever I arrive early in the laundry room
and am waiting for the washer and/or dryer to be done.

In case of the washer, I can use the timer on the washer to time
myself (if I start right at the turn of a minute).

Otherwise, I should rely on my overall intuition about elapsed time
(maybe hum a tune to roughly keep time).

Since I might arrive in time to do only one leg, I should make sure to
do the other leg next time.

## History

My first recorded execution was on 2025-11-18, and my next recorded
execution was on 2025-11-27. In both cases, I was able to do about 2
minutes on the right leg. For the left leg, I did 1 minute on
2025-11-18 (interrupted by the load finishing, so I might have been
able to go further) and didn't get a chance on 2025-11-27. So, as of
2025-11-29, my right leg is at about 2 minutes and my left leg is at
at least 1 minute (and maybe at 2 minutes).
