# Standing on one leg toes with eyes closed (with history)

This is an eyes-closed version of the
[standing-on-one-leg-toes-with-eyes-open
exercise](standing-on-one-leg-toes-with-eyes-open-with-history.md).

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

This is an experimental exercise for which I was not able to obtain
any standard benchmarks for comparison. So, I am uncertain about the
goals and functional relevance.

### Extreme in-the-moment balance

I began balance exercises with [standing on one leg with eyes
closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md), for
which I built my threshold from about 10 seconds prior to 2023-10-28
to over 100 seconds on 2025-12-25 (this is the latest available
threshold as of 2026-01-27). I almost always exceed the threshold on
the first try, so this is a lower bound on my average duration.

I then expanded to [standing on toes with eyes
closed](standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md), for which
I built from a threshold of 15 seconds on 2024-09-09 when I started
the exercise to a threshold of 105 seconds on 2025-12-28 (this is the
latest available threshold as of 2026-01-27). I almost always exceed
the threshold on the first try, so this is a lower bound on my average
duration.

I've also been doing "eyes open" versions of the exercises, where I
can generally manage longer durations. In late 2025, I also started
"with shoes" versions of some of the exercises, where the durations I
manage are significantly shorter, but I'm hoping to improve over time
in those.

On 2025-06-22, I started [standing on one leg toes with eyes
open](standing-on-one-leg-toes-with-eyes-open-with-history.md). When I
started, I set a threshold of 10 seconds, though I was not always able
to hit it even with five tries. The threshold gradually increased till
it reached 25 seconds on 2026-01-16 (and I am generally able to hit
the threshold within five tries).

The general trend over time is as follows:

* For any exercise that I do, doing it reasonably regularly (initially
  daily for the first few exercises, but by late 2025, as encoded via
  the [balance exercise
  cycle](balance-exercise-cycle-with-history.md)) has led to an
  improvement in performance over time.

* I've generally moved to starting harder exercises, adding them to
  the balance exercise cycle, leading to lower frequency for the other
  exercises, and perhaps slower improvement, but on the whole, I have
  been able to improve on both the new exercises and the older
  exercises (perhaps more slowly than before, due to the lower
  frequency).

At the extreme, when it comes to things like injury prevention, what
matters most is to be able to maintain the most precarious balance
(and also to fail / resolve imbalance effectively) in the most
difficult situations. This suggests to me that continuing to improve
duration for the simple exercises (in addition to just being more
time-consuming) is not the best way to go. I therefore want to
introduce increasingly challenging exercises where even maintaining a
small duration is difficult.

The titular exercise of this document has all three features of
difficulty: one leg, toes, and eyes closed. The surface of contact
with the ground is very limited, so balance, fine-tuned motor control,
and strength matter a *lot*.

### Goal: build toward 15 seconds

The goal is to build to where I can stand on one leg toes with eyes
open for about 15 seconds for each leg.

## Protocol

The protocol is to stand on the toes of one leg with eyes open for as
long as possible. I can do multiple tries and record the best try,
though in some cases I might record the best two or three tries.

I should generally do up to five tries on each leg. I can stop if I
hit the threshold of 7 seconds on any try.

## History

### Pre-protocol experimentation

I did two experimental attempts at the exercise on 2026-01-16 and
2026-01-24. This was before formal determination of a protocol
including a threshold.

On 2026-01-27, I documented the protocol going forward.

### History of threshold durations

On 2026-01-27, as part of initial documentation and protocol setup, I
set a threshold of 7 seconds (maximum over 5 tries).
