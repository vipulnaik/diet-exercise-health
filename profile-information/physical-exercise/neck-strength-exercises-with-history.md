# Neck strength exercises (with history)

## Background videos

* [What Nobody Tells You about NECK Training | Build Thickness Safely!
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rn8iDZOzTk) is the thoroughest of all the videos and gives a pretty good overview of the subject
* [How to Build a Strong Neck | Dr. Andrew Huberman | The Tim Ferriss Show
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI-D4JTcOr4)
* [Neck Training Like Andrew Huberman (Results After 4 Weeks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iM_JMW-up0) (this is a response of sorts after implementing the suggestions of the preceding video)
* [Neck Strengthening Exercises (Easy to Hard) Good for Whiplash, Arthritis, etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz-UKE6_GAI) (this starts off at a physical therapy level but ratchets up to relatively hard exercises similar to the starting exercises discussed in the preceding videos)
* [Neck Flexor Endurance Test | Deep Neck Flexors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JEWM_McBmM) seems like a good endurance test to benchmark neck strength (basically, measure the duration of being able to do this hold)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance of a strong neck

* Injury risk: It seems to reduce the risk and magnitude of whiplash,
  and also helps with recovery from whiplash. It also seems to reduce
  the risk of concussions.

* Maybe helpful for hand gripper exercises, particularly the "lower
  neck" considering my previous experience
  [here](../../events/2024/2024-09-27-onward-minor-inflammation-of-lower-neck.md). I
  think neck strength is the main bottleneck to me being able to do
  200 lbs.

* Maybe helpful for long-haul flights where one needs to sit for a
  long duration?

* Maybe helpful for recovery from neck/shoulder pain after vaccines;
  see [here](../../events/2023/2023-10-13-flu-shot.md) for a case
  where I had neck/shoulder pain after a vaccine where I did isometric
  resistance exercises in response.

* Maybe further address my light sensitivity issues, since
  neck/shoulder fatigue is a contributor to my light sensitivity; see
  [here](../best-practices/best-practices-around-light.md) for more
  background.

* "Confidence": This seems more speculative but allegedly, a strong
  neck makes one sit up straighter or stand up straighter, look people
  more in the eye etc. and makes one feel and appear confident. Not
  sure how much this matters to me.

### Kinds of movements, range of motion, and strength

Below are the various pairs of kinds of movements:

* Flexion (nodding down) and extension (nodding up); these are
  effectively rotations in the sagittal plane (i.e., the hea does not
  move left or right)

* Lateral flexion (to the left) and lateral flexion (to the right);
  these are effectively rotations in the coronal plane (i.e., the head
  does not move forward or backward)

* Rotation (to the left) and rotation (to the right); these are
  effectively rotations in the tranverse plane (i.e., the head does
  not move up or down)

* Compression (shrink head/neck down) and decompression (stretch
  neck/head up)

For each of these, these are different kinds of exercises:

* Range of motion exercises without resistance, where the exercise is
  performed to the fullest extent that it can be done without pain or
  discomfort, for a few repetitions. For instance, nodding the head up
  and down is a flexion/extension range of motion exercise. We can do
  pairs of opposites alternating (for instance, rotate left then
  rotate right, then rotate left again, etc.) or just do one side for
  a few repetitions.

  Range of motion exercises confirm that things are working, and are
  helpful as warmup. Outside of a physical therapy situation after an
  injury, they aren't that helpful to increasing strength. But they
  are important for warmup before proceeding to strength exercises.

* Isometric resistance exercises, where resistance is provided to a
  head/neck "trying" to move in a certain direction, and the
  resistance and the force applied by the head/neck cancel. The
  resistance should be as high as possible so that the head/neck can
  just about cancel it, with the neck muscles tight.

  Each of the directions of motion has a corresponding isometric
  resistance exercise. For instance, for flexion, we can provide
  resistance by pushing back on the forehead. For extension, we can
  provide resistance by pushing forward on the back of the head.

  Since I'm doing the exercises by myself, I am using my own strength,
  usually with my hand, for the resistance part as well, so it's
  double exercise. Generally, my hand strength will be more than my
  head/neck strength so it will still be good for pushing my head/neck
  strength to the limit.

* Exercises for motion against resistance, where resistance is
  provided but the head/neck still prevails and moves (slowly) against
  the resistance. While similar in strength training to isometric
  resistance exercises, these exercises train the strength not just in
  the resting position but in motion.

## Protocol

* Do the range of motion exercises right before the isometric
  resistance exercises as well as at any other time when I have the
  freedom to do it (for instance, when walking, doing dishes, etc.) up
  to 2-3 times a day. In each round, do 5 repetitions of each. Half
  the time, do the 5 reps for each exercise together, and the other
  half of the time, do the 5 reps alternating between opposite
  exercises (for instance, 5 of flexion intertwined with 5 of
  extension).

* Do the isometric resistance exercises at the end of the day, before
  falling asleep, on alternate days. Do at least one repetition for a
  few seconds of each of the directions. Record in the Slack self-chat
  logs as `nsed`.

* Do the neck flexor endurance test once every 2 weeks or so and
  record the hold duration.

## History

I did a few of the isometric resistanec exercises, specifically the
lateral flexion ones, without understanding the full concepts, when
researching my neck/shoulder pain after my [2023-10-13 flu
shot](../../events/2023/2023-10-13-flu-shot.md).

I've been doing the range of motion exercises for neck strength
informally since around 2024-09-27, after the inflammation of the
lower neck described
[here](../../events/2024/2024-09-27-onward-minor-inflammation-of-lower-neck.md).

I did the initial research on neck strength exercises, and started
doing the exercises, on 2025-02-18. While these have been on my mind for a while, there were a couple of impetuses:

* The discussion of a strong neck in [Joe Rogan's interview of Mark
  Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1ehaE0bdU)

* Neck strength coming up in the context of my research into whiplash
  on 2025-02-17 after seeing many plane accidents in the news (the
  specific trigger was
  [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Connection_Flight_4819)).

I collated the research into a document on 2025-02-21.

I did the first formal neck flexor endurance test on the night of
2025-06-24 (this ended up being much later than I originally planned,
as my hope had been to do this once every 2 weeks after starting the
neck strength exercises). I got durations of 45 seconds and 50 seconds
respectively.
