# Standing on heels with eyes open (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

This is an experimental exercise for which I was not able to obtain
any standard benchmarks for comparison. So, I am uncertain about the
goals and functional relevance.

Two main benefits come to mind.

### Increasing the duration helps with relatively tricky forms of upper body balance and stability

Unlike the case of standing on toes, where there is a wide surface
area offering more optionality for how to balance, standing on heels
is trickier because the surface area of contact is very small, and
it's very hard to keep the center of gravity consistently above this
surface area of contact.

There are two ways. One is to luck into a really good starting
configuration and then not move at all, which requires a lot of luck
and endurance. I find it hard to maintain that level of stability for
more than a few seconds.

The other is to fall and readjust quickly while falling.

Unlike cases of standing on one leg or on toes, where a strong leg and
strong toes respectively help with relative weight redistribution to
compensate for upper body movement, here the game is almost entirely
about upper body balance and stability.

### Graceful failure is useful training for catching myself when I slip

When I do end up failing, it's important to fail gracefully, i.e., not
fall down. Normally, I don't get practice of this because I don't get
in situations where my balance situation is this bad, but deliberately
trying to stay in this unstable position for a while produces
interesting failure cases.

### Tentative goal: 3-second minimum and 10-second maximum over two minutes of trying

My tentative goal is to target a minimum over tries of at least 3
seconds and a maximum over tries of at least 10 seconds for as many
tries as I can do over a period of two minutes. Recording both a
minimum and a maximum is in recognition of the significant variation
based on factors of luck including the starting configuration.

## Protocol

The protocol is to try as many attempts to stand on heels with eyes
open over a period of about two minutes, allowing for a gap / rest
period between attempts of up to three seconds.

I then record the minimum and maximum over all the attempts over the
two-minute period. My goal is to try to get as high a minimum and as
high a maximum as possible.

## Triggers for overall exercise

I've been doing this exercise daily starting Friday 2025-06-20,
generally as a followup to [standing on one leg with eyes
closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md). The
stipulations regarding the conditions under which to do the
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise apply to this exercise
as well.

## History

### First attempt on Friday 2025-06-20 and followup plus formalization on Sunday 2025-06-22

I made my first recorded attempt on Friday 2025-06-20. I was able to
achieve a max of 8 to 9 seconds at least once with a bit of forward
leaning and a wide leg spread. I did not record the minimum but I
think it was around 2 seconds.

I tried again on Sunday 2025-06-22, getting a minimum of about 2
seconds and a maximum of about 7 seconds. I also formalized the
exercise structure on this day, including setting conventions on
overall duration and recording of minimum and maximum.
