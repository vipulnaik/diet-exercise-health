# Dynamometer grip strength with history

See [hand gripper exercises (with
history)](hand-gripper-exercises-with-history.md) for context.

## Initial setup and data collection

On 2025-11-26, I placed an order with Amazon for a
[dynamometer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJSPV6DQ). I picked it up on
2025-12-09, but things were busy at the time, so I only got around to
opening the dynamometer on 2025-12-20.

In the first try, I got maximum scores of 88.8 lb with the right hand,
77.2 lb with the left hand, and 103.4 lb with both hands.

These scores are about half of what I expect based on the hand
grippers I am able to close (150 lbs in the two hands individually and
200 lb with both hands together). The hand gripper that came with the
dynamometer was consistent with my experience with hand grippers; at
the max setting of 60 kg (about 132 lb) I was able to close
comfortably, and it felt somewhere in between the 100 lb and 150 lb
hand grippers.

Digging into the cause, I learned that the dynamometer measures static
(isometric) grip strength -- the strength I can summon without
movement. In contrast, the hand gripper measures dynamic (isokinetic)
grip strength. Training on the hand gripper improves the latter more
than the former, and it's often the case that people who do practice
with hand grippers do better on the latter than the former.

In my case, I do close-and-hold practice with the hand gripper, that
offers a hybrid of sorts between static and dynamic practice, but
effectively the rating of the hand gripper is based on the "strength
to close" and not the "strength to hold", so using that rating gives a
deceptive picture of grip strength.

## Protocol

The planned protocol is to do dynamometer grip strength testing
periodically in lieu of hand gripper exercises (i.e., I take a break
from hand gripper exercises and do dynamometer grip strength testing
instead, at the time I would usually do the hand gripper exercises).

I should take one measurement of each of these:

* Right hand grip strength

* Left hand grip strength

* Both hands together grip strength

I should record results in a Slack self-chat log message. After a few
measurements, I will be able to get a clearer picture of my level and
trend.
