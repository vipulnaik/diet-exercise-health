# Push-ups (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

Push-ups are good for upper body strength, both abdomen/torso area and
arms and hands.

Based on guidelines such as
[this](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/fitness/art-20046433),
my current aim is to ramp up to 25 standard push-ups (see the standard
exercise description below) without getting out of the push-up
position (but allowing stretch breaks while staying in
position. While I don't have concrete goals for variants, I also hope
to explore other kinds of push-ups including knuckle push-ups, wrist
push-ups, and finger push-ups.

## Current protocol

I generally do push-ups after [weight-lifting
exercises](weight-lifting-exercises-with-history.md). I do this set
once every 3 days.

### Standard exercise: palm, toes, both hands and both feet, normal hand spacing, nose touch

For my standard push-up, I follow this protocol:

* Palm for upper support (as opposed to wrist, knucle, and fingers)

* Toes for lower support (as opposed to knees)

* Both hands (as opposed to one hand)

* Both feet (as opposed to one foot)

* Normal hand spacing (as opposed to reduced or increased hand spacing)

* Nose touch to count a complete push-up

To count a pushup, I require my nose to touch the exercise mat. As the
mat can curl up a bit, the level can be about 1-2 inches above the
level of my hands.

I generally stay in the push-up position through the full set. I do 4-8
repetitions and then break (while staying in the pushup position) for
leg stretches. Then I continue with the pushups.

The number of push-ups I can manage can vary quite a bit. When I'm
feeling low on energy, it's in the range of 10-15. When I am higher on
energy, it's in the range of 17-22.

## History

### 2021-11-02: start of push-ups

On 2021-11-02, I started push-ups along with weight-lifting
exercises. At the time of starting, I was only able to do about 2-3
push-ups.

### By late 2022 or early 2023: about 13 to 22 push-ups

By late 2022 or early 2023, I had reached a level of about 13 to 22
push-ups (with a range of 10 to 15 when a little fatigued and a range
of 17 to 22 when more energetic). Since then, and until about
2024-11-14, my count of push-ups has stayed roughly the same.

The lack of improvement in push-ups since early 2023 may be partly
because I do push-ups after jogging and weight-lifting, so while on
the one hand I am sufficiently warmed up, on the other hand I am also
more fatigued. However, if I can increase my number of push-ups under
these conditions to about 25, then I should be in good shape.
