# Standing on toes with eyes open (with shoes) (with history)

This is a "with shoes" variant of [standing on toes with eyes
open](standing-on-toes-with-eyes-open-with-history.md).

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance and distinction from the normal at-home version without shoes

My standard standing-on-toes-with-eyes-open exercise is done at home
without shoes.

The "with shoes" variant has very similar benefits, though it is a
little harder than without shoes due the lack of direct tactile
feedback. However, the difference here is less pronounced than for
standing-on-one-leg exercises, where the shape of the shoe means that
I don't have simultaneous ground contact of the heel and toes, which
is crucial for good tactile feedback. When standing on toes, whether
with or without shoes, either way I am only getting feedback at the
toes, so the difference is more minor. There's still some difference
from the feedback being more indirect via the shoe versus direct floor
contact.

### Build to / maintain consistent standing-on-toes-with-eyes-open with shoes on for about 3 minutes

About 3 minutes on toes is reasonable. My first attempt was 208
seconds, which is already above the threshold, so if that wasn't a
fluke, then maintaining should be good enough.

## History

My first recorded execution was on 2025-12-28 in the laundry room
while waiting for the dryer. It was about 208 seconds, estimated (I
did not have a timer to measure, so I was using my sense of time,
which is accurate up to about +/- 5%.
