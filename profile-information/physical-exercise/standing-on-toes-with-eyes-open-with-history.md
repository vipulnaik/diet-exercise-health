# Standing on toes with eyes open (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Maintain standing-on-toes-with-eyes-open duration at at least 3 minutes

The exercise of standing on toes with eyes open is complementary to
the exercise of standing on toes with eyes closed. The main difference
is that whereas the eyes-closed version is primarily constrained on
balance (i.e., loss of balance is the main reason for ending in most
cases), the eyes-open version is primarily constrained on the strength
and stamina of the leg. With that said, there does seem to be a
positive correlation between the two exercises.

My goal is to maintain a standing-on-toes-with-eyes-open duration of
at least 3 minutes. I believe this is a reasonable amount of time,
though I don't have very clear reasons for picking that particular
duration.

The main benefits are as follows:

* The exercise improves the strength and stamina of my toes. This
  strength and stamina is useful for extended walking and running
  because there's a huge amount of weight on the toes during the
  takeoff portion.

* The exercise may help me with extended standing, by strengthening
  one portion of the feet.

## Protocol

The process is as follows:

* Stand on my toes (both feet). Both the toes and the portion of the
  foot right before the toe can be in contact with the ground.

* Note the start time. Try to stay in that position for as long as
  possible, without repositioning either foot. Lifting or sliding
  either foot is not allowed, and contact of the rest of the foot with
  the floor is also not allowed. A little bit of rocking is permitted.

* Note how long I was able to sustain the position.

## Triggers for overall exercise

I generally do this exercise at least once a month as a followup to
[standing on one leg with eyes
open](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-open-with-history.md). I may also
do this exercise separately, for instance, while waiting in between
cooking for water to fill or to soak.

## History

My attempts have been as follows:

* 2025-02-18: 104 seconds
* 2025-02-21: 111 seconds
* 2025-03-09: 171 seconds
* 2025-06-23: 205 seconds
* 2025-07-05: 241 seconds

As of 2025-07-05, it seems that I can now consistently manage over 3
minutes, though more tries are needed to paint a clearer picture.
