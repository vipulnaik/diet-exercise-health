# Standing on one leg with eyes closed (with shoes) (with history)

This is a "with shoes" variant of [standing on one leg with eyes
closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md).

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Functional relevance and distinction from the normal at-home version without shoes

My standard standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise is done at
home without shoes.

The "with shoes" variant has very similar benefits, but with a few
differences:

* It's much harder than without shoes (at least for the kind of shoes
  I wear, which are far from barefoot). The main challenge is the lack
  of simultaneous ground contact of the heel and toes. The toes are
  particularly important for both gripping and feeling the floor, but
  when flat on my heel, they are not pressed against the ground.

* It may be more functionally relevant to maintaining balance when
  wearing shoes, which is all my time outdoors (and where both the
  risk and the potential damage of injury are greater).

* The specific exercise that I do, that involves waiting at a traffic
  light, also helps verify (and perhaps maintain) my ability to
  process auditory information to sense direction. Specifically, my
  goal is to detect based on the sound of traffic when the traffic
  light has switched, and open my eyes based on that (assuming I could
  maintain my balance until that point). Maintaining a strong auditory
  sense of my environment is a useful skill, both as a hedge against
  vision loss and to deal with issues such as blind spots or stuff
  happening outside my field of vision that is relevant.

* The specific exercise also helps build my intuition about elapsed
  time, which is useful.

### Build to consistent standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed with shoes on for the duration of waiting for a traffic signal (about 30 seconds)

The duration of a traffic light while I am waiting at it is a natual
fit for this exercise, since I anyway don't have other stuff to do
while waiting. About 30 seconds is also a reasonable amount of time
for standing-on-one-leg balance as may be needed outdoors, and that's
about the duration I have to wait for a traffic light.

## Protocol

When I arrive at a traffic light and don't have the walk sign on, then
after pressing any button needed to request a walk sign, I get on one
leg and close my eyes. I then try to maintain balance and listen to
the traffic. My goal is to not lose balance, and only deliberately
open my eyes once I think the walk sign would have switched, based on
what I can hear of traffic and based on my sense of elapsed time.

## History

I have done this exercise informally a few times before, but I first
started documenting its execution in Slack self-chat logs on
2025-10-20.

As of 2025-11-11, my general impression is that I can manage about 10
to 20 seconds on the right leg but only about 5 seconds on the left
leg. This is way less than what I can manage at home, without shoes.
