# Hand gripper exercises (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercises

### Build peak strength I can crush (to 200 lb)

I can currently crush the 150 lb with both hands, but am unable to
crush the 200 lb with either hand. My goal is to build toward the
point where I can crush the 200 lb, even if it is just for a second.

It may be that getting to 200 lb requires addressing other
constraints, such as increasing protein intake or doing other
complementary exercise. This is evidenced by the fact that progressing
from 100 lb to 150 lb was relatively quick, but progressing from 150
lb to 200 lb has been taking a while (though that's also partly
because I haven't been trying that much). It would be good to
understand and address these, though I would be fine if it takes a
while to get to 200 lb.

Functional relevance: strong peak grip strength can be helpful in
sticky situations. Probably the most likely real-world scenario where
these are needed is opening tight lids and caps. While peak grip
strength is generally not needed, opening tight lids with wet soapy
hands is one use case where I still don't have adequate peak strength
in some cases.

### Maintain how long I can keep the 150 lb and 100 lb closed

As of 2025-05-26, I can keep the 150 lb closed for about 15 to 31
seconds in my right hand and about 7 to 25 seconds in my left hand. I
can keep the 100 lb closed for about 20 to 45 seconds in my right hand
and about 15 to 35 seconds in my left hand when done immediately after
the 150 lb. The lower end of the duration range dropped a little bit
in late April as a result of hand muscle pain, and then again stayed
low in May, while the high end stayed stable. I attribute the
reduction in the lower end to reduction in my available strength as a
result of travel-related adjustment, with the reduction particularly
salient during periods where I was making adjustments to my sleep
cycle. The reduction may also have to do with changes to my diet and
other exercise patterns in India.

I think this duration is good enough, and in practice, trying
to crush for longer will just end up using more and more of my time
without clear benefits. Although I do expect some organic improvement
in how long I can close, I am not focusing on building to longer
durations.

I can also close the 150 lb with my little finger excluded in my right
hand; I can close the 100 lb with either the little finger or the
index finger excluded in my right hand. The durations with fingers
excluded are much shorter than the corresponding durations with all
fingers. With my left hand, I have not been able to close the 150 lb
excluding any fingers, and I am not consistent about closing the 100
lb though I usually manage the little finger.

Functional relevance: 150 lb is more than my body weight, so being
able to grip 150 lb with a single hand for 15 to 25 seconds should be
enough for most real-world situations, including opening lids, using
handrails for support, and even rock climbing (?). Being able to do
100 lb for longer durations makes it clear that grip strength is not
the bottleneck for lifting heavy weights. I think strong grip strength
has been helpful occasionally for carrying complex, unwieldy loads
(where it's not just the weight of the load but the awkward way it
hangs which means I need to use grip strength).

## Current protocol and status as of 2025-12-29

### First of 3-day cycle: 150 lb and 100 lb close-and-hold with all fingers (focus on maintaining)

I do this sequence every alternating day in the morning, with the
steps in quick succession:

* Right hand on 150 lb: I close and keep closed for about 19 to 40
  seconds (as long as I can). I usually average about 22 to 30
  seconds.

* Left hand on 150 lb: I close and keep closed for about 12 to 30
  seconds (as long as I can). I usually average about 17 to 23
  seconds.

* Right hand on 100 lb: I close and keep closed for about 25 to 45
  seconds (as long as I can). I usually average about 30 to 40
  seconds. If I were to start with the 100 lb instead of doing the 150
  lb first, I would be able to do more, but then I would not be able
  to do the 150 lb immediately aferward. That's why I start with the
  150 lb.

* Left hand on 100 lb: I close and keep closed for about 20 to 40
  seconds (as long as I can). I usually average about 25 to 35
  seconds. If I were to start with the 100 lb instead of doing the 150
  lb first, I would be able to do over 20 seconds, but then I would
  not be able to do the 150 lb immediately aferward. That's why I
  start with the 150 lb.

#### Repetition swap-in for this cycle

I occasionally swap into this day of the cycle the following
variant:

* Right hand on 150 lb: Hold and immediately release, and do
  successive repetitions, as many as I can, with a cap of 10
  repetitions.

* Left hand on 150 lb: Hold and immediately release, and do
  successive repetitions, as many as I can, with a cap of 10
  repetitions.

* Right hand on 100 lb: Hold and immediately release, and do
  successive repetitions, as many as I can, with a cap of 20
  repetitions.

* Left hand on 100 lb: Hold and immediately release, and do
  successive repetitions, as many as I can, with a cap of 20
  repetitions.

As of 2025-12-20, I don't plan to do repetition swap-ins for other
exercises where the hold durations are not yet high enough, so that my
focus is still on increasing hold durations first.

I also haven't decided how often I will do this swap-in. It could be
as often as half the time (so effectively both exercises will be once
every 6 days) or it may be less frequent.

### Second of 3-day cycle: 150 lbs and 100 lb close-and-hold excluding specific fingers (focus on building)

* Right hand on 150 lb: I try to close and keep closed (or as far
  toward closed as I can get) excluding my little finger and then
  separately excluding my index finger.

  * Excluding the little finger: I close and keep closed for 0 to 10
    seconds.

  * Excluding the index finger: I am not consistently able to close;
    when I do succeed, I keep closed for 0 to 5 seconds.

* Left hand on 150 lb: I try to close and keep closed (or as far
  toward closed as I can get) excluding my little finger and then
  separately excluding my index finger.

  As of 2025-12-20, I have not been able to fully close with the left
  hand excluding either of the fingers.

* Right hand on 100 lb with specific fingers excluded: I try to close
  and keep closed (or as far toward closed as I can get) excluding my
  little finger and index finger (together and separately).

  * Excluding both the little finger and index finger: I close and
    keep closed for 0 to 5 seconds.

  * Excluding the little finger: I close and keep
    closed for 10 to 25 seconds.

  * Excluding the index finger: I close and keep
    closed for 10 to 25 seconds.

* Left hand on 100 lb with specific fingers excluded: I try to close
  and keep closed (or as far toward closed as I can get) excluding my
  little finger and index finger (together and separately).

  * Excluding both the little finger and index finger: I try to go as
    far as I can toward closing and hold for as long. I can usually go
    1/2 or more of the way from parallel to fully closed and hold at
    that position for 0 to 5 seconds.

  * Excluding the little finger: I close and keep closed for 5 to 20
    seconds.

  * Excluding the index finger: I close and keep closed for 3 to 20
    seconds.

### Third of 3-day cycle: 200 lb close (focus on building -- very far from being able to do this)

* Right hand on 200 lb: I try to close the 200 lb as far as possible
  and hold it at the maximum I was able to get it to for as long as
  possible. I record both how far I got in closing (as a fraction of
  the way from parallel to fully closed) and how long I was able to
  hold in that position.

  As of 2025-12-20, I have been able to get between 2/3 and 5/6 of the
  way and hold for anywhere from 4 to 12 seconds, generally getting to
  about 5 to 8 seconds.

* Left hand on 200 lb: I try to close the 200 lb as far as possible
  and hold it at the maximum I was able to get it to for as long as
  possible. I record both how far I got in closing (as a fraction of
  the way from parallel to fully closed) and how long I was able to
  hold in that position.

  As of 2025-10-18, I can go from slightly beyond parallel to 1/2 of
  the way from parallel to fully closed (I usually manage 1/3 of the
  way from parallel to fully closed) and hold for about 5 to 9
  seconds.

* Both hands together on 200 lb with right hand on the inside: I try to
  close the 200 lb with both hands together, with the right hand on
  the inside, and hold closed for as long as possible. If I am able to
  close successfully, I do a second attempt (after attempting the next
  bullet point) and hold closed again for as long as possible.

  As of 2025-12-20, I am usually able to close at least once, and
  often twice. The first hold time is somewhere between 0 seconds and
  15 seconds, usually about 5 to 8 seconds. The second hold time, if I
  succeed, is generally somewhere between 0 seconds and 3 seconds.

* Both hands together on 200 lb with left hand on the inside: I try to
  close the 200 lb as far as possible with both hands, with the left
  hand on the inside, and hold it at the maximum I was able to get it
  to for as long as possible.

  As of 2025-12-20, I am able to go anywhere from 1/3 to 3/4 of the
  way from parallel to fully closed and hold for anywhere from 1 to 5
  seconds. How far I can go depends inversely on how long I held the
  previous round.

### Occasional break from cycle for dynamometer grip strength measurement

Occasionally (about once every 1 to 2 weeks) I should take a break from
hand gripper exercises and instead do dynamometer grip strength
measurements. The process for these is documented in
[dynamometer-grip-strength-with-history.md](dynamometer-grip-strength-with-history.md).

### Reasons for skipping

* **Sickness or recent medical treatment**: See similar explanation
  for jogging.

* **Preemptive break to relax and conserve energy**: See similar
  explanation for jogging.

* **Hand injury**: If I have a cut on one of the hands, I want to skip
  the hand gripper exercises for that hand to avoid putting stress
  on the cut.

* **Preemptive break to improve hand appearance**: If there are
  particular reasons I really care about having good hands, I might
  take a break from the hand gripper; however, at this point since I
  am pretty comfortable with the 100 lb and 150 lb hand grippers, this
  is not a consideration. It was more of a concern when I was still
  new to these grippers.

## History

### Initial purchase on 2023-07-05

On July 5, 2023, I placed an order for a set of 3 hand grippers: 100
lb, 150 lb, and 200 lb. I picked the order up on July 8. However,
since I was still recovering from wisdom tooth removal at the time,
and then had antibiotic-induced digestive issues, I did not
immediately start using the hand grippers.

### Initial use on 2023-07-29

Eventually, on 2023-07-29, I started using the 100 lb hand gripper.

### Observations as of the first few days of using the 100 lb hand gripper

* I can crush the hand gripper fully and consistently when I use both
  hands, with my left hand on one side and my right hand on the other
  side.

* Generally, my right hand seems to have greater grip strength,
  *almost* fully crushing the hand gripper consistently. By my second
  day (2023-07-30) I was able to get my right hand to *fully* crush
  the hand gripper on the first try of each set of tries (e.g., if I
  would wait a few minutes and then try, the first try I would crush
  fully). But even so I was not able to crush it on the second try in
  *most* cases, and never on the third try.

### Update on 2023-08-08

By this time I can consistently and comfortably crush the 100 lb hand
gripper with my right hand. Also, I have been able to occasionally
fully crush the hand gripper with my left hand, but not consistently.

### Update on 2023-09-04

I took a break for a few days before after my wisdom tooth removal
(between Monday 2023-08-21 and Monday 2023-08-28). I resumed on
Tuesday 2023-08-29, but limited to one round per day.

On Monday 2023-09-04, I resumed the use of the 100 lb hand gripper for
multiple rounds a day. I found that now I can comfortably and
consistently close with both hands. With that said, it's still easier
with the right hand.

This led me to experiment (for the first time since I started using
the hand gripper) with the 150 lb hand gripper. Unsurprisingly, I
wasn't able to close this hand gripper with either hand (each hand
individually was only able to partially close up to the "vertical"
stage). With both hands together, I was able to close the 150 lb.

### Update on 2023-09-06

For the first time ever, I was able to close the 150 lb hand gripper
with my right hand. However, I was not able to repeat this feat
immediately. I expect to be able to repeat it sporadically over the
next week or so and to take at least a week before I can do a
consistent close with my right hand.

I felt pain in the area of my fingers that had pressed the gripper
after closing this; it was clearly effortful.

### Update on 2023-10-23 / 2023-10-24 / 2023-10-25

I am now occasionally just about able to close the 150 lb hand gripper
with my left hand. I can also now reasonably consistently close the
150 lb hand gripper with my right hand. I continue to be able to
comfortably close the 100 lb hand gripper with either hand, though
with the left hand it still is a bit displaced sometimes.

### Intermittently reduced right hand strength on 2023-10-27

On Friday 2023-10-27, I tried the hand gripper at 9 AM. I was able to
comfortably close the 100 lb with both hands, but was not able to
close the 150 lb with either hand. Whereas not being able to close it
with the left hand was as expected, not being able to close it with
the right hand was unexpected.

When I tried again shortly after 10 AM, the situation with my left
hand hadn't changed, but my right hand had further deteriorated, with
it just barely being able to close the 100 lb sometimes (and not even
being able to close it at other times).

I applied vaseline and waited a minute and tried again. The situation
had now reverted to what it had been around 9 AM: I could close 100 lb
comfortably with both hands, but I couldn't close 150 lb with either
hand.

I tried again after a minute, and now I was just barely able to close
the 150 lb with my right hand.

### Update on 2024-03-17

Starting this day, I am planning to do a daily practice of keeping the
100 lb hand gripper closed for at least 5 consecutive seconds with
each hand separately. 5 is about what I can reasonably do right
now. I'm hoping to increase it gradually to a larger amount, like 10
seconds.

### Update on 2024-05-07

As of now, I am generally able to keep the 100 lb hand gripper closed
in either hand for at least 10 seconds, and occasionally going up to
20 seconds, albeit with slight quivers (where it opens up a little bit
and I immediately close it back, in well under a second). For the 150
lb, with my right hand, I am able to keep it closed for about 3-5
seconds.

### Update on 2024-05-13

For the first time ever, I took out my 200 lb hand gripper and started
trying to close it. After a few attempts, I was able to get it to the
parallel position with each hand individually, but no further. I was
able to get it to close by wrapping one hand around another for the
last portion (from parallel to close).

### Update on 2024-08-02

For the last few weeks, I have switched to a practice of doing the 150
lb hand gripper and then the 100 lb hand gripper every morning, and
keeping them closed for several seconds.

This is the sequence I have been following:

* Right hand on 150 lb: I close and keep closed for about 4-10 seconds.

* Left hand on 150 lb: I close and keep closed for about 4-10 seconds.

* Right hand on 100 lb: I close and keep closed for about 10-20
  seconds (generally about 15 seconds); if I were to start with the
  100 lb instead of doing the 150 lb first, I would be able to do over
  20 seconds, but then I would not be able to do the 150 lb
  immediately aferward. That's why I start with the 150 lb.

* Left hand on 100 lb: I close and keep closed for about 10-20
  seconds (generally about 15 seconds); if I were to start with the
  100 lb instead of doing the 150 lb first, I would be able to do over
  20 seconds, but then I would not be able to do the 150 lb
  immediately aferward. That's why I start with the 150 lb.

### Update on 2024-09-09

The main change since the last update is a slight increase in the time
I can stay closed with the 150 lb.

Here is the protocol as of this time:

* Right hand on 150 lb: I close and keep closed for about 7-12 seconds.

* Left hand on 150 lb: I close and keep closed for about 7-12 seconds.

* Right hand on 100 lb: I close and keep closed for about 10-20
  seconds (generally about 15 seconds); if I were to start with the
  100 lb instead of doing the 150 lb first, I would be able to do over
  20 seconds, but then I would not be able to do the 150 lb
  immediately aferward. That's why I start with the 150 lb.

* Left hand on 100 lb: I close and keep closed for about 10-20
  seconds (generally about 15 seconds); if I were to start with the
  100 lb instead of doing the 150 lb first, I would be able to do over
  20 seconds, but then I would not be able to do the 150 lb
  immediately aferward. That's why I start with the 150 lb.

### Update on 2024-09-22

I have decided to make the bundle of 150 lb and 100 lb exercises (that
are now at a maintain level) every alternate day, and on the other
alternate day, try the 200 lb, which is what I am trying to build to.

### Update on 2024-09-28

For the building exercises, I've created a more elaborate exercise for
the 200 lb, and added an exercise for 100 lb with specific fingers
excluded.

### Update on 2025-01-16

I made a few protocol updates on 2025-01-16 reflecting recent
improvements; I have now been recording privately my performance every
day, so I have a clearer picture of how well I am doing.

* I increased the range of durations that I am able to keep the hand
  gripper closed under various settings, to reflect recent
  improvements.

* I removed 200 lb from the protocol.

* I included closing 150 lb for the alternate days where I do the 100
  lb with a finger excluded; this reflects the new process I have been
  following *de facto*.

### Update on 2025-02-04

I made a few minor protocol tweaks:

* I increased the range of durations that I am able to keep the hand
  gripper closed for my right hand, reflecting recently observed
  increases. I did not update the range of durations for the left
  hand, as the included range seems to reflect recent performance
  reasonably accurately.

* I added the word "sometimes" to the point about failure to close the
  hand gripper when it is cold. This reflects the fact that in recent
  times, I have been able to close the hand gripper even in the
  morning (though it may have just been the case that my hands have
  not been as cold recently as they used to be).

### Update on 2025-02-28

I increased the range of durations that I am able to keep the hand
gripper closed with each hand, based on a review of data over the
past few weeks.

### Update on 2025-05-26

In light of recent lower durations of hold, likely due to
travel-related adjustment and fatigue, I have reduced the lower end of
the duration range in the protocol. I have also indicated that I now
try the 150 lb with fingers excluded on alternate days (starting
2025-05-21).

### Update on 2025-07-09

I reintroduced attempts to close 200 lb, and in the process switched
from alternating between two protocols (close-and-hold with all
fingers, close-and-hold with specific fingers excluded) across two
days to alternating between three protocols (those two and attempt to
close 200 lb) across three days.

### Update over the month of 2025-08 (written retroactively on 2025-10-18)

I updated the 200 lb protocol to not just closing as much as possible
but also trying to hold at the maximum for as long as possible, and
started recording how long I had been able to hold. This update didn't
happen on a single day for all parts of the protocol, but rather
happened gradually through the month as I transitioned parts one by
one.

### Update on 2025-10-18

I documented the updated current state of things for the 200 lb
protocol (there are no meaningful changes to my performance for the
other protocols).

### Updates on 2025-12-20

On this day, I did testing with a new dynamometer and a hand gripper
that came along with the dynamometer. I confirmed that the 60 kg
setting for the hand gripper was (subjectively for me) somewhere in
between the 100 lb and 150 lb hand grippers, suggesting that the
calibration is not too far off.

However, I noticed that the dynamometer measures much lower grip
strength (see
[dynamometer-grip-strength-with-history.md](dynamometer-grip-strength-with-history.md)),
roughly about half of what I would have expected. Based on further
research, it looks like the two strength measures can diverge because
the dynamometer is a static (isometric) strength measurement and the
hand gripper is a dynamic (isokinetic) strength measurement. Practice
with the hand gripper therefore overtrains for the dynamic strength
side of the picture versus the static strength side -- the ability to
just summon a lot of strength without movement.

By doing close-and-hold exercises, I was aiming effectively for a
hybrid of the two: using dynamic strength to achieve the closure, then
static strength to keep it closed.

I also decided that to really properly overtrain the dynamic side and
reap its full rewards, I should add in repeated closings; this is
covered as the third point in the list below.

I made several updates to the protocol and current status:

* I updated the status in terms of how consistently I can do exercises
  and the typical hold durations I manage. The updated versions are
  based on a review of performance over the past two months.

* I removed several outdated comments, including notes added
  2024-11-15 from back when I was not able to consistently do
  particular exercises, as well as notes about regression in hold
  durations during my India trip.

* I added a swap-in for the first exercise set that I can do
  occasionally, where instead of closing and holding, I do repeated
  closing. This is a new swap-in; other than an initial experimental
  attempt, I do not have experience with it. The protocol may get
  refined over time.

### Updates on 2025-12-29

I added the exercise (for both hands) of trying to close the 100 lb
hand gripper excluding both my little finger and my index finger. For
the right hand, I am able to close and hold briefly; for the left
hand, I cannot fully close. The exercises were added to the second of
the 3-day cycle, along with the other exercises of closing with
fingers excluded.

I had previously attempted to close with my right hand excluding both
the little finger and index finger on 2025-09-20 and 2025-09-23, and
been unsuccessful both times. I then did not try for three months.

I next tried and succeeded with the right hand was on 2025-12-25, but
I did not attempt the left hand on that date. 2025-12-29 was the first
date I attempted both hands, and after that I decided to add this
exercise to the protocol.
