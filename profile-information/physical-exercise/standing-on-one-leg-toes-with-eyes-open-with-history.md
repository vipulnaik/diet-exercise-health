# Standing on one leg toes with eyes open (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

This is an experimental exercise for which I was not able to obtain
any standard benchmarks for comparison. So, I am uncertain about the
goals and functional relevance.

### Increasing the duration should help with balance and prediction of balance

This is similar to [standing on heels with eyes
open](standing-on-heels-with-eyes-open-with-history.md) in that there
is very little surface area of contact so I need to get on the right
footing and stay on that right footing in order to keep my center of
gravity over that narrow area. This requires good balance and good
prediction and estimation of balance.

### Goal: build towards 30 seconds

The goal is to build to where I can stand on one leg toes with eyes
open to about 30 seconds for each leg.

## Protocol

The protocol is to stand on the toes of one leg with eyes open for as
long as possible. It's okay to do multiple tries and record them
all. Tries that immediately abort (in less than 2 seconds) can be
skipped, but if I abort more than three tries successively I should
document this.

I should do up to five tries on each leg. I can stop if I hit the
threshold of 10 seconds on any try.

## History

I started doing this exercise on Sunday 2025-06-22.

On 2025-06-26, I documented the exercise and set the threshold as 10
seconds.
