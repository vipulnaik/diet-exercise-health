# Smell checklist

As of 2026-01-12, the steps I take for smell are largely either
spontaneous (I spontaneously notice a smell) or deliberate sniffing in
the course of other activities (such as meal prep). The periodic
checklist is just to check in with myself that I have been doing
these.

Execution log is [here](../logs/smell-checklist-log.md).

- [ ] Confirm that I have experienced at least one incident of pronounced smell gradient upon return to apartment (`psgurta` in Slack self-chat logs) in the past 3 months
- [ ] Confirm that I have been regularly sniffing condiments (turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper / red pepper) for meal preparations and have had success doing so

END OF CHECKLIST
