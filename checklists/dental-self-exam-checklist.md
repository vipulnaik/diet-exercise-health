# Dental self-exam checklist

Execution log is [here](../logs/dental-self-exam-checklist-log.md).

- [ ] Examine teeth in mirror; look for things like stains, plaque, and recession
  - For front teeth, look in the normal mirror, using the hands to pull parts of the mouth to get a better view
  - For back teeth, open mouth wide; use the dental mirror particularly for the back middle teeth and to get an additional angle on the back side teeth (the back side teeth can be partly viewed directly in the mirror if the mouth is wide open)
  - Stain: some distinctive color pattern, usually black, often seen on back side teeth
  - Plaque: "thin, slightly fuzzy, colorless film that might not be readily visible to the naked eye, but you can often feel it with your tongue as a slightly rough texture on your teeth" though in some cases it can show a yellow discoloration
  - Gum recession: gumline is receded from where it should be; the place where it should be is the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and any gap between that and the gumline means the cementum is exposed; this gap area tends to look yellower than the white tooth
- Use pressure testing to confirm the health and strength of the teeth; there should be no sharp pain beyond the sensation of pressure and maybe in some cases a stretch or massage feel, and it should go away within a few seconds of the pressure being removed
  - [ ] Using a floss pick, push moderately hard against each interdental gap
  - [ ] Push backward with a clean finger on the exposed part of each of the front teeth
  - [ ] Push forward (outward) with a clean finger on the exposed part of each of the back teeth
  - [ ] Push backward with a clean finger on the gumline part for each of the front teeth
  - [ ] Push forward (outward) with a clean finger on the gumline part of each of the back teeth
- [ ] Take photos of front and back teeth using the intraoral camera and save to GitHub in the following order (there should be a total of 12 photos)
  - All back teeth before all front teeth
  - Within each, all upper (maxillary) teeth before all lower (mandibular) teeth
  - Within each, left, then middle, then right
  - The location to save in GitHub should be in the `diet-exercise-health-private` repo in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - Also save in my Google Drive in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- [ ] Compare these photos with the previous photos
