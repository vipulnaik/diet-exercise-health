# Vision checklist

Execution log is [here](../logs/vision-checklist-log.md).

- Functional short distance vision test (computer reading): Try the exercise in https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/typing at the usual eye-to-screen distance (17 to 25 inches, usually 20 to 23 inches)
  - [ ] Both eyes at 25% magnification (threshold of 70 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
  - [ ] Left eye only (right eye closed) at 75% magnification (threshold of 80 wpm on at least one of three attempts)
  - [ ] Right eye only (left eye closed) at 75% magnification (threshold of 80 wpm on at heast one of three attempts)
- Functional slightly-longer distance vision test: Read vaseline and supplement bottle texts (30 to 35 inches)
  - [ ] Both eyes
  - [ ] Left eye only
  - NOTE: Keep both eyes open for about a minute before proceeding to the right eye; this helps with refocusing
  - [ ] Right eye only
- Functional medium distance vision test: Try to read the FineDine and Craftsman packages at a distance of about 6 feet (basically, read them seated); start at a slight angle and then work my way to straight reading
  - [ ] Both eyes
  - [ ] Left eye only
  - NOTE: Keep both eyes open for about a minute before proceeding to the right eye; this helps with refocusing
  - [ ] Right eye only
- Peripheral vision check
  - [ ] First, make sure the screen brightness and ambient lighting are such that I cannot detect the color change of the reaction time test when looking diametrically opposite the screen; this is to make sure I can only pass the reaction time test by detecting color changes on the screen
    - In dark environments, I may need to put the light on, otherwise the color change on screen is visible through reflection of the light elsewhere even when I am not facing the screen
  - [ ] Confirm that I am able to get a reaction time under 500 ms when facing at an angle of 110 degrees with the screen on my left (so I would be using the left eye effectively)
  - [ ] Confirm that I am able to get a reaction time under 500 ms when facing at an angle of 110 degrees with the screen on my left (so I would be using the left eye effectively)
- Functional long distance vision test: Verify that I can read a license plate for first parked car across the street when at intersection, assuming that the parked car leaves space for one car to allow turns (and see how much earlier I can read the license plate)
  - [ ] Both eyes
  - [ ] Left eye only
  - [ ] Right eye only
