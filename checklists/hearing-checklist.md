# Hearing checklist

- Run through and record results for online hearing test at https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test (using normal headphones for air conduction and bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) in SQL; compare with the previous results to see if there is any concerning loss of hearing, and if so, schedule a followup test for a week later
  - [ ] Put on normal headphones
  - [ ] Make sure that the volume of the computer is set to max
  - [ ] Check that the left speaker is on the left ear and the right speaker is on the right ear (this might require temporary balance adjustment)
  - [ ] Switch balance back to the middle
  - [ ] Do the Resound online test and record results as you go along
  - [ ] Put on bone conduction headphones
  - [ ] Make sure that the volume of the computer is set to max
  - [ ] Check that the left speaker is on the left ear and the right speaker is on the right ear (this might require temporary balance adjustment)
  - [ ] Switch balance back to the middle
  - [ ] Do the Resound online test and record results as you go along
- Run through and record results for test where I try to play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) all in one ear and find the lowest possible volume for each ear where I can make out the words -- if it's higher than 1/64, schedule followup test in about a week
  - [ ] Make sure that within-YouTube volume is set to max
  - [ ] Left ear with normal headphones (if the headphones are oriented wrong, re-wear the headphones)
  - [ ] Right ear with normal headphones
  - [ ] Reduce within-YouTube volume to 50%
  - [ ] Left ear with normal headphones (if the headphones are oriented wrong, re-wear the headphones)
  - [ ] Right ear with normal headphones
  - [ ] Left ear with bone conduction headphones
  - [ ] Right ear with bone conduction headphones
  - [ ] Reduce within-YouTube volume to 50%
  - [ ] Left ear with bone conduction headphones
  - [ ] Right ear with bone conduction headphones
- Check for balance when I play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo
  - [ ] Normal headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [ ] For normal headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness
  - [ ] Bone conduction headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [ ] For bone conduction headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness
